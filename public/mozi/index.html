      <h2 id="life"><strong>Life</strong></h2>
<p>The philosopher Mo Di, more commonly known as Mozi (or “Master Mo”) lived sometime between the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. Although we don&rsquo;t have a great deal of information about Mozi as an individual, the evidence suggests he was born, as was <a href="/confucius">Confucius</a>, in the state of Lu. Many later writers have suggested that he came from the artisan class, and thus was something of an outsider to the high society of Warring States China.</p>
<h3 id="philosophy-as-carpentry"><strong>Philosophy as carpentry</strong></h3>
<p>It has been suggested that Mozi was a wheelwright or a carpenter. The idea that he was a craftsman is attractive. As with <a href="/socrates">Socrates</a> over in Greece, this suggests that he might have been a thinker who knew something about practicality, who knew how to do stuff other than just philosophising.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that Mozi uses metaphors of craft in his writing to talk about the practice of philosophy. He uses the metaphor of the wheelwright&rsquo;s compasses and the carpenter&rsquo;s square as metaphors for what he calls “the intention of heaven” (<em>tian zhi</em>). But it is also clear that Mozi was conversant with the teachings of Confucius, and with the literary traditions of his time, and there are suggestions that he acted as an adviser to rulers. The translator Ian Johnston weighs up the evidence and concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given the prominence of the school, the most plausible account of his life is that it was passed in travelling and teaching, with perhaps occasional periods in some official position in a particular state.‌‌‌‌<strong>The Mozi: A Complete Translation, p. 21</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever the case, it is generally agreed that Mozi died in advanced old age, some time at the end of the fifth century BCE, or the beginning of the fourth century BCE.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="philosophy"><strong>Philosophy</strong></h2>
<p>The tradition of philosophy initiated by Mozi is known in English as Mohism. The teachings of this tradition are collected together in a book simply known as the <em>Mozi</em>, which was compiled by the philosopher&rsquo;s followers. The doctrines at the heart of Mohism were <em>tian zhi</em> or “the intention of heaven” and <em>jian ai</em>, which is usually translated as “universal love” or “inclusive care.”</p>
<p>During the centuries after Mozi&rsquo;s death, Mohist philosophy was widespread and popular. The Confucian philosopher Mencius grumbled that “The doctrines of <a href="/yang-zhu/">Yang Zhu</a> and Mozi fill the world.”</p>
<p>But with the rise of the Han dynasty, Confucianism took centre stage, and Mohism went into decline. Nevertheless, of the seventy-one books of the original <em>Mozi,</em> fifty-eight still survive in one form or another.</p>
<h3 id="the-intention-of-heaven"><strong>The intention of heaven</strong></h3>
<p>For Mozi, the idea of the intention of heaven is the idea that the universe is, at the most fundamental level, morally constructed. Mozi argues that righteousness (<em>you yi</em>) is productive, contributing to the life of the world, while unrighteousness  (<em>wu yi</em>) is unproductive. The world is constituted in such a way that rapaciousness, absence of care for others, and greed lead inevitably to “death”—to poverty, disorder and chaos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do I know that Heaven desires righteousness and abhors unrighteousness? I say that when the world is righteous, it &ldquo;lives&rdquo;, and when it is not righteous, it &ldquo;dies&rdquo;. When it is righteous, it is rich. When it is not righteous, it is poor. When it is righteous, it is well ordered. When it is not righteous, it is disordered. So then, Heaven desires its (the world’s) &ldquo;life&rdquo; and abhors its &ldquo;death&rdquo;. It desires its wealth and abhors its poverty. It desires its order and abhors its disorder. This is how I know that Heaven desires righteous and abhors unrighteousness.‌‌‌‌<strong>The Mozi: A Complete Translation, p. 235</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the task of a good ruler is to rule in accord with the underlying moral tendencies of the universe, to bring about a just and moral system of government.</p>
<h3 id="universal-love">Universal love</h3>
<p>This idea of the intention of heaven links in closely with one of the Mohists most famous doctrines, that of “universal love.” The term “universal love” or “inclusive care” is shorthand for a longer, more telling slogan: <em>jian xiang ai, jiao xiang li</em>, or “universal mutual love, connected mutual benefit.”</p>
<p>For the Mohists, benefit does not have to be a zero-sum game. It is possible to build a society that is characterised by universal mutual love and care, a society that will benefit all equally. Such a society is in accord with the intention of heaven. This makes it the maximally functional (or minimally dysfunctional) form of society. The <em>Mozi</em> puts it as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Undoubtedly what Heaven desires is that there be mutual love and mutual benefit among people. What it does not desire is that there be mutual hatred and mutual harm among people‌‌‌‌.<strong>The Mozi: A Complete Translation_, p. 27_</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Mozi, the hallmark of this absence of care is a concern for one&rsquo;s own benefit to the detriment of others. But when you balance a care for all equally, you are in accord with the intention of heaven.</p>
<h3 id="love-punishment-and-war">Love, punishment and war</h3>
<p>The Confucians objected to all this. They argued that partiality is not a flaw, but is instead central to human care. The Confucian argument is that it is right and proper that we are more partial to our family than we are to strangers. This is not a shortcoming or a moral lapse. Instead, it is a guarantor of order. Within Confucianism, social order is based upon a network of interlocking relationships of care, each of different intensity.</p>
<p>The Confucian view makes some degree of psychological sense: we naturally care more for those closest to us. If all is well, we don&rsquo;t usually need to be <em>told</em> to care for those who are in our circle of intimates. Our caring for them is spontaneous, unlike our caring for those who are more distant from us.</p>
<p>But this differential care also brings problems in its wake. One such problem is nepotism, the overlooking of faults in those close to us, and the favouring of those with whom we have closer links (if you want to read more, <a href="/love03-something-so-right/">read this piece on whether you should take your father to court for stealing a sheep</a>). For the Mohists, this partiality is problematic. And universal love is the way to go.</p>
<p>But even if we accept the Mohist argument for universal caring, the question is this: how do we put in place a society characterised by this kind of universal love?</p>
<h3 id="love-and-force">Love and force</h3>
<p>It is at this point that the <em>Mozi</em> makes an uncomfortable suggestion. To establish a society based on universal love, what is required is a system of sagely rule that impartially rewards impartiality, and equally impartially punishes partiality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now things like universal mutual love and the exchange of mutual benefit are both beneficial and easy to practise in innumerable ways. I think it is only a matter of not having a ruler who delights in them, and that is all.If there was a ruler who delighted in these things, and encouraged people with rewards and praise, and intimidated them with penalties and punishments, I think the people would take to universal mutual love and interchange of mutual benefit just like fire goes up and water goes down and cannot be stopped in the world.”‌‌‌‌<strong>The Mozi: A Complete Translation_, p. 163-5_</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It might seem, at first glance, that the Mohists&rsquo; concern with universal love would translate into a kind of pacifism. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>Instead, Mozi himself is said to have advised on military strategy; and the <em>Mozi</em> contains chapters on defensive warfare: from fortifications to walls and gates to weapons. Because if anything is worth protecting, as far as the Mohists are concerned, then it is universal love. Universal love might be a worthy goal. But the Mohist admission that it needs to be underwritten by intimidation raises uncomfortable questions about its viability.</p>

            "tags": ["Blogs",],
            "content": "My own philosophical education happened more or less by accident. In my twenties, I was a serious practitioner of Buddhism. I lived in a succession of Buddhist communities, working in temporary jobs, living on a shoestring, and spending my days writing and meditating. It was not financially sustainable in the long term, and the books I wrote at the time were all more or less unpublishable; but during these years of Buddhist practice, I had the luxury of having time to think. Several friends from back then — who are still friends today — were philosophically inclined. So we read Buddhist philosophy, and Kant, and Epicurus, and Martha Nussbaum, and the Stoics, and this was pretty much how my early philosophical education started — through conversation, and friendship, and an attempt to grapple with the business of living.\nLater, I signed up for a PhD at Staffordshire University. I studied part-time, and because I hadn\u0026rsquo;t studied philosophy before and had some catching up to do, I found myself a couple of small jobs teaching adult education in Birmingham, where I was living. I proposed a one-year philosophy course for beginners, calling it “From Heraclitus to Heidegger: An Introduction to Philosophy.” And for the following months, with a rag-tag group of philosophers, we worked through the Western canon of philosophy, reading big chunks of Plato and Aristotle, Hegel and Schopenhauer.\nOver the years of my PhD, I continued to teach philosophy courses, following my nose, filling in the gaps. One of my favourite classes was in the Birmingham Botanical Gardens study centre, where a flock of spirited and badly-behaved pensioners came to chat about philosophy every Friday afternoon. They were raucous good fun. Twice a week, I commuted from Birmingham to Stoke-on-Trent, where I took part in philosophy reading groups and met with my supervisor. By now, my Buddhists commitments were waning, but I continued to talk to Buddhist friends about this and that. And this, more or less, is how I came to learn philosophy: through talking through texts and ideas with people who were, in the main, not professional philosophers. Through conversation.\nAs the end of my PhD loomed, I wondered about next steps. Should I apply for a post as a philosophy academic? But I was not entirely sure that the idea of a being a professional philosopher made sense (I\u0026rsquo;m still not). To profess — and what else do professionals and professors do? — is to declare publicly. Now, public declarations are all very well, if you know what you want to say, or what you think. But part of philosophy is, for me, developing a habit of unease about what you think, holding back on public declarations so that you have time to think a bit more deeply, with greater nuance (though see what I\u0026rsquo;ve written elsewhere on deep amateurism and deep professionalism). On the other hand, to be an amateur is to be a lover. It is about doing something because it matters to you, because it gives shape to your life, because, well, you love doing it. So if philosophy is indeed the love of wisdom, I began to suspect that amateurs have a head start. As a result, I instead accepted a job teaching creative writing, thinking — correctly, it turned out — that this would give me a bit more room to move.\nBecause of my commitment to amateurism, I have always felt less than at home in the academy. In academic settings, I rarely feel that I have the elbow room I crave — the freedom to think, and discuss, and explore, and be wrong, without getting tangled up in anxieties about professional standing, and without being too oppressed by instrumental demands. And this is why I have preferred to continue doing most of what I do as a philosopher outside academic circles. Give me an Epicurean garden over a stuffy seminar room any day.\nThis is one reason why I\u0026rsquo;m particularly delighted to have started a new project here in Tainan. A few months ago, I was wandering past the wonderful Wansha Performing Arts Centre (涴莎藝術展演中心), when I fell into conversation with Mr. Chen, the director. He invited me in for tea, we got chatting, and over the months that followed as our conversations developed, we ended up making a plan for a series of public philosophy salons. The salons meet monthly on a Saturday afternoon, and we get together to read and talk about philosophy together in English and Chinese. Our first salon was just over a week ago, where we discussed the philosophy of music, exploring the ideas of Plato and Xunzi, and listening to music from Burmese punk to Sun Ra, from Grieg to the Thai Elephant Orchestra, and from Taiwanese indigenous music to Stockhausen.\nThe Wansha Performing Arts Centre is a beautiful space — much closer to my Epicurean ideals than to the professional world of the academy. And the salon is entirely free to attend, which feels as it should be. We are continuing this little Epicurean experiment for the rest of the year, so if you are in Tainan (and why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you be — it\u0026rsquo;s on the National Geographic cool list for 2024), then come along. But I\u0026rsquo;m also using the salon to give extra impetus to Looking for Wisdom, and I will be publishing regular articles on the website after each salon, talking about the issues that we have been exploring. So even if you can\u0026rsquo;t make it to Tainan, you can get a flavour of our conversations. Because, for me, it has always been the case that conversation is where philosophy flourishes.\nImage: Scholars in Conversation, Eastern Han Dynasty. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\n",

            "content": "On 21 January, we ran our first Wind\u0026amp;Bones public philosophy salon in Chinese, in collaboration with the Wansha Performing Arts Centre (涴莎藝術展演中心) in Tainan, Taiwan. We\u0026rsquo;re running these salons monthly, and we\u0026rsquo;re planning to publish an essay on the topic of the salon after each one. This is the first one, where we talked about philosophy and music.\nA human universal Music is about as close to being a human universal as anything. Human beings everywhere holler, sing, drum their fingers, tap their toes, chant, whistle… But the question of what music is, and how we can best think about music, is one that has preoccupied philosophers for centuries.\nThe Confucian philosopher Xunzi at the beginning of his treatise on music, both attests to the universality of music, and also argues that music is rooted in human emotion. “Music is joy,” Xunzi writes, “an unavoidable human disposition” (夫樂者、樂也，人情之所必不免也).\nMusic and joy In both Classical and contemporary Chinese, these two ideas of music and joy are so close, they share the same character: 樂. The two readings of the character are only distinguished by their pronunciation. Spoken as “lè”, the character means “joy”, and spoken as “yuè”, it means music. According to my etymological dictionary, the latter meaning is the primary one: 樂 depicts a stringed instrument, where the upper component (𢆶) represents the strings, and the lower component (木) represents a wooden structure. The bit in the middle — 白 — is a component that originally indicated the sound of the word.\nI like this idea that music is rooted in joy, in part because philosophical approaches to music often seem pretty abstract. But thinking about music as joy roots it in our bodily experience: the way music vibrates through us. When I was a teenager, I played classical guitar. Every morning at six o\u0026rsquo;clock, I would creep downstairs, click on the electric fire to drive out the cold, and practice for an hour or more. And what I remember most of those chilly mornings was the feeling of how, when I plucked the strings, the body of the guitar thrummed against my body, the sheer physicality of how music runs through us, the joy of it.\nBad tunes There is something challenging about this for philosophers because so much of what music does to us seems to happen prior to all our theorising. Xunzi writes that “sound and music enter into us quickly, and transform us” (夫聲樂之入人也深，其化人也速) — perhaps before we have even had a chance to know that this is what they are doing. And this has led to a philosophical suspicion of music. Or, at least, certain kinds of music. Xunzi is all for music that leads to harmony and the proper ordering of society. But he worries about the social effects of the wrong kind of music, saying that “If music is dissolute and dangerous, then the people will be dissolute, arrogant, vulgar, and base” (樂姚冶以險，則民流僈鄙賤矣).\nThis anxiety is a surprisingly recurrent one, and Xunzi is not alone in this worry. In early 20th Century America, there was a moral panic around jazz, rooted in the racist fears of white America (you can read some well-chosen examples here). In an article published in the Chattanooga News (August 25, 1919), Harold K. Phillips decried “shimmery, shivery, shimmy syncopations, ear-splitting jazz music and public vulgarity poorly disguised as dancing”, and argued — very much in line with Xunzi — that we should encourage “more graceful and more moral trots to the tune of a tempo.” Meanwhile, Dr. Henry van Dyke, a professor at Princeton theological seminary, claimed in The New York Herald (March 13, 1921) that “Jazz… was invented by imps for the torment of imbeciles. True, it does not contain any distinct immoral teaching because music is not a didactic art, but jazz does contain a real immoral influence because it confuses, bewilders, benumbs and befuddles the mind through the ears. It is, in effect, the dope or knockout drop in the art of sound.”\nMusic and moral education Plato more or less agreed, and for this reason, believed that education could not ignore music. Here he is ventriloquising Socrates in The Republic.\nAnd so, Glaucon, isn\u0026rsquo;t this why musical education is so important? Firstly because rhythm and mode penetrate more deeply into the inner soul than anything else does; they create the strongest foundation, since they bring gracefulness with them. They make a person graceful, if he is rightly brought up, and the opposite, if he is not.\nThe language here is very close to Xunzi. Rhythm and mode, “penetrate more deeply into the inner soul than anything else does.” As for Xunzi, so for Plato: the right kind of music can lead to a proper social harmony, but the wrong kind of music can lead to chaos. But for Plato, there is something else happening as well. Because of this directness, Plato argues, through music the young can develop a feeling for order and disorder, for what is beautiful and well-made, and what is ugly and badly made. Through proper education in music, the soul becomes more refined, so that when we get to an age where we are capable of reason, we can recognise reason by its sheer beauty and order — as if it were an old friend — and delight in it. Music doesn\u0026rsquo;t just make us harmonious. It makes us rational.\nMessy music and messy joy for messy lives This is all very well, and I confess that I do love the exquisitely ordered mathematical intricacies of Bach, for example. But I\u0026rsquo;m uneasy with attempts to impose moral frameworks on music in the way that Xunzi and Plato do, just as I am uneasy with way in which, a century ago, the proponents of “more graceful and more moral trots” poured scorn on jazz.\nThere are several reasons for this unease. One is that these calls to order all too often mask the exercise of power. In early 20th century America, the moral condemnation of jazz was inseparable from the broader culture of racism. And in Xunzi\u0026rsquo;s China, it\u0026rsquo;s hard not to think that what a ruler may consider to be chaos may, for their subjects, be the end of an oppressively stultifying rule.\nThe second reason is that it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely clear that music does go straight to the soul, without the mediation of culture. Some of the tunes those early American critics of jazz most feared, and that they deemed impossibly hard on the ears, are the same tunes that are piped out as easy-listening in contemporary restaurants and coffee-shops: safely retro, reassuring, no longer strange and unfamiliar. The meanings of music change as the culture changes.\nBut the final reason goes back to Xunzi, and the double meaning of 樂 as music (yuè) and as joy (lè). Because if music is joy, then we have on our hands something much less amenable to our control than we imagined. Joy may be calm, harmonious, steady. But equally, it may be raucous, fractious and wayward — spilling out over the sides, unpredictable and unruly. Joy — rooted in the body and its cross-currents, its surges and gusts of life and energy, its processes of ordering and disordering — is not a single emotion. We human beings, to the regret of philosophers, are irredeemably messy. And our joys are sometimes — often, perhaps — messy joys. Sometimes, to quote Conor Oberst\u0026rsquo;s song The Road to Joy, you just want to fuck it up and make some noise. Sometimes, you may need to. And there is creative power, and goodness, in this as well.\nJoy and Power A final thought: perhaps you can read Xunzi\u0026rsquo;s treatise on music instead as a treatise on joy, and on how bodily joy is a threat to power — one that needs to be channelled and managed so that this power can be maintained. When Xunzi writes, “When all the dancers are restrained and orderly, exerting to the utmost the strength of their bones and sinews to match the rhythm of drum and bell sounding together, and no-one is out of step, then how easy it is to tell the meaning of this group gathering,” he does not sound far different from Harold K. Phillips and his praise of “moral trots.” And while there are joys to be found in moral trots and restrained, orderly rhythms, there are other joys too, joys that are less easily tamed.\nAnd if we find that the orchestration of our joys is in the service of structures that are unjust in their exericse of power, as we sometimes might, there may be not just the temptation, but also the moral demand to fuck things up, to find ourselves out-of-step. Because sometimes goodness lies in harmony; but at other times, it lies in refusing to trot along with the demands of power. It lies in our fractious hollering and singing, the drumming of our fingers and tapping of our toes, our whistling, and our chanting, our propensity to dance and whoop and wail…\nReferences: Xunzi (trans.

No sooner had we set up the new site than we got involved in all kinds of other projects, and we had no choice but to put our work on the site temporarily to one side. Since we last posted, Hannah has had a short story collection accepted for publication and so is busy with endless edits, and Will has accepted a full-time job with Parami University in Myanmar, working online teaching philosophy and writing.\nMeanwhile, we have been moving our lives from Scotland to Taiwan. It\u0026rsquo;s taken a lot of organising to get here, but a month ago, we relocated from Dundee to the wonderful city of Tainan.\nWe\u0026rsquo;d been planning to move to Taiwan for quite a few years — although Covid and life got in the way for a while. But now we\u0026rsquo;re here, we\u0026rsquo;re planning some fun projects.\nOne of the up-coming things we\u0026rsquo;re most excited about is a project that will explore the connections between food, stories and philosophy. Tainan, Taiwan\u0026rsquo;s oldest city, is a city of stories. It is also a city of foodies. So we are working on a something that will look at the connections between how we live, how we think, the stories we tell, and how we eat. We\u0026rsquo;ll post more when things have started to come to fruition.\nAfter our brief hiatus, we still have plans to continue publishing here on the site, although on a somewhat more relaxed schedule than in the past. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to dust off the newsletter as well. So do look out for our upcoming posts and emails.\n",

            "content": "When we moved the Looking for Wisdom HQ up to Scotland a year ago, we packed away all our philosophy books into boxes. There were a lot of boxes. So on the outside, with a big fat marker pen, we wrote the words: “Philosophy Books (warning: extremely heavy).” As jokes go, it was a pretty feeble one. But it kept us entertained through the stresses of the move.\nThis idea that philosophy is inherently and necessarily heavy is one that has a broad currency. The first recourse for the unimaginative philosophy publisher, looking for something to stick on a book cover or a website, is Rodin\u0026rsquo;s Le Penseur. That furrowed brow! That muscular male torso? That dark, brooding glint of bronze! The heroism! The seriousness! The sheer heft and heaviness of it all!\nAnd this, we are often encouraged to believe, is what philosophy is all about. But what if it isn\u0026rsquo;t? Or not, necessarily? What if seriousness is not always a virtue, or if there are other virtues that might be set alongside the virtue of seriousness—equally persuasive, and equally revealing?\nIn the mood Another way of putting this is that many people assume that philosophy requires not just a certain way of thinking, but also a certain way of attuning yourself to the world in which you find yourself. It requires a certain mood. And the mood it requires is a sombre one.\nBut what is a mood? And why should it matter to how we do philosophy? When you start to think about it, mood is a more complex and puzzling thing than it first seems. Moods are somehow nebulous. On the one hand, they are obvious and all-pervasive. We are in a particular mood, and our current mood seems to colour everything. But at the same time, moods are hard to grab hold of or to pin down.\nFor philosopher Martin Heidegger, mood (Stimmung) is fundamental to our relationship with the world. Mood is about our attunement (Befindlichkeit) to the world. Moods assail us, take us over, elevate us, lay us low… but we are always in some kind of mood or other. Even the apparent absence of mood (what Heidegger calls “The often persistent, smooth, and pallid lack of mood”) is itself a kind of mood, and is, Heidegger writes, “far from being nothing” [1]\nFor Heidegger, mood discloses the world to us. Think about how, if you are in a bad mood, the world seems hostile. People on the bus are more annoying than usual. Even inanimate objects like door handles are suddenly out to get you, snagging on your new jumper as you pass. Now imagine that you are skipping home from a successful first date. The world is kissed by sunshine and joy. Everyone smiles. The traffic lights change just when you need them to. The world is overflowing with kindness.\nThis makes the mastery of our moods one of the challenges of human life. But we can never master our modes by driving them out. We can\u0026rsquo;t free ourselves from mood altogether. Instead, the best we can do is by finding our way towards a counter-mood. Heidegger writes,\nWhen we see the “world” in an unsteady and wavering way in accordance with our moods, what is at hand shows itself in its specific worldliness, which is never the same on any given day. [2]\nYou might think that a purely theoretical perspective — the dispassionate gaze of the philosopher in their ivory tower — could somehow escape this wavering flux of mood. But Heidegger says no. Even the purest theōria, or disinterested contemplation, he says, does not abandon all moods. Because ultimately, “Every understand­ing has its mood,” and, “Every attunement understands.” [3]\nThe Spirit of Gravity If moods disclose particular kinds of worlds, and give rise to particular kinds of understanding, this forces us to ask what is disclosed by the default mood of high seriousness in which we habitually read philosophy. Of course, heavy philosophy, and weightiness in general, may have their virtues. But when you want to move house — after lugging all those boxes up to your new third-floor apartment, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t even have an elevator — weight seems far less appealing, less of a virtue, than it once did. So are there things that we simply don\u0026rsquo;t see, or can\u0026rsquo;t see, when we are hunched up like Rodin\u0026rsquo;s sculpture, our brows furrowed, our bodies heavy, having weighty thoughts?\nOne philosopher who was fed up with all this weight was Friedrich Nietzsche. The trouble with weight, for Nietzsche, is that it stops us being able to dance. It makes us less light on our feet, less aware of our bodies, less alive. Nietzsche had a name for this obsession with weight and seriousness: he called it the “Spirit of Gravity.” In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, he wrote,\nI would only believe in a god who knew how to dance.\nAnd when I saw my devil, there I found him earnest, thorough, deep, sombre: it was the Spirit of Gravity – through him all things fall. [4]\nThe antidote to the Spirit of Gravity is the ability to laugh. Nietzsche, always solicitous of our digestive processes, counsels us as follows: “Ten times you must laugh by day and be cheerful, or else your stomach will bother you at night, this father of gloom” [5]. Because if there is anything at all that can rid us of this spirit of gravity, it is laughter: “Not by wrath does one kill,” Nietzsche says, “but by laughing. Up, let us kill the spirit of gravity!” [6]\nNietzsche for laughs Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s book is full of laughter. He writes about mocking laughter and about laughter that flutters like a colourful cloud. He discusses the laughter of malice and the laughter of love. He writes about the laughter of children, of gods, and even of lions. He writes about laughter at oneself and at others. Thus Spoke Zarathustra is a bundle of laughs. And to the extent that Nietzsche has a method for doing philosophy, laughter is close as anything to being this method.\nBut it is also clear — from even a cursory glance at Thus Spoke Zarathustra — that for Nietzsche, laughter is not a single thing. It is complicated. It spills out over the sides. It is unruly. It resists orderly classification and definition. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know what it is doing. Ha! Ha! Ha! Nevertheless, even when we read Nietzsche, we tend to miss the laughter. Instead, we succumb to the very Spirit of Gravity that Nietzsche has tried so hard to kill off.\nWhat do those philosophers who write about Nietzsche spend their time doing? They write serious papers, engage in minute arguments, talk about Nietzsche as if they are speaking the most weighty truths about the most weighty aspects of human life. And it is hard not to see this heaviness as something close to a betrayal.\nImagine a conference of Nietzsche scholars, and what comes to mind? Do you picture a boisterous group of light-footed and joyful human creatures, exploding uncontrollably into heady, intoxicating laughter, leaping to their feet every so often to dance? Or do you picture a serious group of thinkers, seated in a room that smells of stale coffee, hunched like Rodin\u0026rsquo;s statue, oppressed by the weight of everything as they ask what it could all possibly mean?\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s the question: if you picture the latter, you have to ask: are these philosophers (whether real or imagined) really talking about Nietzsche at all?\nMissing the laughter The trouble with the Spirit of Gravity is not just that it gets in the way of our urge to dance (although dancing may be a Good Thing). It also risks getting in the way of making sense of what Nietzsche is saying. Can we really understand Nietzsche if we don\u0026rsquo;t laugh along with him (or if we don\u0026rsquo;t dance along with him)? What are we missing, what do we misconstrue, if we come to Nietzsche in this mood of high seriousness?\nThis is not just a problem with reading Nietzsche. It holds for reading other works of philosophy as well. When we are in the grip of the Spirit of Gravity, our reading of philosophy becomes unnecessarily restricted. We start to miss things. Above all, we miss the fact that philosophy is written by human beings, with a full range of human moods. If mood really does disclose a “specific worldliness”, as Heidegger puts it, then restricting ourselves to a single philosophical mood is going to narrow our vision. When seriousness reigns, what kinds of specific worldliness are we at risk of forgetting?\nFreeing ourselves from the Spirit of Gravity offers us a route back to more interesting ways of reading philosophy. If we no longer feel the obligation to imagine that every word is heavy with serious intent, we can start to remind ourselves that philosophers are, after all, human beings. And what we know about human beings is that they are by turns serious and silly, trivial and profound, focussed and distracted, insightful and clueless. Even when they are writing philosophy. Often, when we start reading, we forget this fact. We shuffle into the shadow of the Spirit of Gravity, furrow our brows, and get unbearably serious. But this leads us to miss the sheer human complexity of what we are reading.\nWorse than this, we risk lapsing into a kind of high-mindedness that leads to us making stuff up, simply because we can\u0026rsquo;t believe our ancestors were anything other than rigorously serious and incontestably great. In this way, a passing joke buried in an obscure corner of a text becomes elevated to the status of a profound metaphysical puzzle. A slip of the pen, or an inadvertent aside, becomes the fodder for endless commentary, giving rise to a thousand PhD theses. A bad argument is refashioned over the centuries until, in the light of endless commentary, it becomes seen as a deeply subtle insight. And so it goes on.\nReading differently On the other hand, when we start to recognise that the mood of high seriousness is not the only option, that there are other ways of both writing and reading philosophy, we can begin to free ourselves from the Spirit of Gravity.\nAnd then what? How do we then read philosophy? One possibility is that we can start to reimagine the art of reading philosophy as the art of struggling to attune ourselves to the changing moods of the text we are reading. This is not easy. For one thing, we already know that moods are hard to pin down, difficult to put into words. For another thing, gulfs in time, space, language, and culture can make moods difficult to translate. Not only this, but moods can be changeable, from one paragraph to the next, even from one sentence to the next. We cannot assume that a single text has a single mood.\nNevertheless, this is a good start. Reading with the knowledge that mood matters, and that it is never straightforward, allows us to discover things that we would not otherwise discover.\nBut there are other ways of reading philosophy too. If there is a virtue in reading philosophy while being attentive to what we imagine the mood of the text may be, there is also virtue in reading texts against the grain. What if we deliberately read in a different mood, to see what that discloses?\nThis can be tricky too, because philosophers can suck you into the particular mood or climate of their writing. Mood, after all, is contagious. We are in a bad mood, the people around us catch the same mood. Even the cat ends up grumpy. But when a cheerful friend comes to knock on the door, everybody (including the cat) suddenly cheers up. The same is true for philosophy. The mood of any particular thinker or text can be highly contagious. It draws us in, allowing us to see certain things, but blinding us to other things.\nFortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s no obligation to read philosophy in the mood in which we think, imagine, or suspect it was written, or was intended to be read. We are free to choose to read it differently, in a different mood, in the hope that we can spot different things.\nPhilosophy, and the proper care of the stomach This aspiration to read philosophy differently is, in the end, why Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s celebration of laughter is worth taking seriously, or at least laughing along with. Because if the overwhelming mood of a lot of philosophy seems top be presided over by the Spirit of Gravity, there is a profound liberation to be found in reading for laughs. When we are freed from the obligation to always be serious, or from the oppressive fantasy that our ancestors were themselves monsters of seriousness, chinks start to open up. And through these chinks, we can see the light of new possibilities, new understandings, or at the very least, newly creative misunderstandings.\nThis may seem a risky route to take. It may be that reading philosophy for laughs will lead your philosopher friends to shun you. So what? Laugh it off! It may be that all this laughter will lead you up a blind alley. What a hoot! Just retrace your steps, dancing as you go, and seek out another path!\nBecause at the very least — as Nietzsche reminds us — reading philosophy for laughs will aid your digestion. And your stomach will not bother you at night.\nRead the whole series on seven ways of reading philosophy\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "content": "At Looking for Wisdom, we are always interested in the cross-currents between literature and philosophy. For a long time, we\u0026rsquo;ve been particularly obsessed by the Medieval Chinese text, the Wenxin diaolong (文心雕龍) or The Carving of Dragons and the Literary Mind, written by a scholar called Liu Xie.\nLiu was an interesting figure. He lived between the fifth and sixth centuries, and he brought together the philosophical thought of Daoist thinkers like Laozi and Zhuangzi, Confucians such as Mencius and (of course) Confucius himself, and the traditions of Buddhism. In his lifetime, he rose to a position of middling eminence, but didn\u0026rsquo;t attain the fame that he wanted. He retired to a monastery, took on the robes of a Buddhist monk, and spent the final months of his life in some obscurity.\nIt was not until long after his death that the brilliance of Liu\u0026rsquo;s Wenxin diaolong was widely recognised. Liu\u0026rsquo;s book is an ambitious work that explores the art of writing. But it is much more than this, because Liu puts this art in the context of a much more wide-ranging philosophy of pattern or wen (文). Liu begins his book with these words:\n文之為德也大矣，與天地并生者何哉\nPattern is a very great power indeed. Is it not born alongside heaven and earth?\nWhat follows is a subtle, fascinating exploration of the nature of creativity. You can read more about Liu in this blog post by Looking for Wisdom\u0026rsquo;s Will Buckingham.\nA New Project Because we\u0026rsquo;ve long been interested in Liu\u0026rsquo;s work, we\u0026rsquo;re very excited to be running a new project exploring the Wenxin diaolong, and asking what significance it might have for readers — and writers — in the present era. In January 2023, Wind\u0026amp;Bones (the social enterprise that keeps Looking for Wisdom running) was awarded a Connections Through Cultures grant by the British Council explore Liu\u0026rsquo;s book with a group of contemporary writers from the UK and China.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll be running a workshop for six writers, two from the uk and four from China, and then commissioning a series of new literary works in English and Chinese. These will be cross-translated and published on the project website in both languages.\nYou can visit the project website by clicking the image below:\n",

            "content": "There is perhaps no headache greater than that of being a head of state. Or, in fact, being the head of anything. From the ancient world to the present day, it has been recognised that to be a ruler is to be condemned to a life of constant vigilance. You have to spend your days on the look-out for plots and enemies. You have to keep an eye on the unfolding power-plays within your court. And you rarely sleep easy in your bed.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s all pretty exhausting: whether you are a monarch ruling over some corner of the ancient world, or the boss of a global media empire, like Logan Roy in the TV series Succession. It\u0026rsquo;s not even just a human thing. Research among baboons shows that being high-ranking can be as stressful — albeit in different ways — as being low-ranking. The best kind of baboon to be is a middle-ranking one, if you want a comfortable life.\nStill, the lure of power is seductive. And so, if you cannot resist the temptations of power, you will need your wits about you. And you will need some good advice for how to navigate through the squalls and the storms that are a fact of life for those in power. This is where the Indian philosopher Kauṭilya comes to the rescue with his Arthaśāstra, or \u0026ldquo;Treatise on Success.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Crooked Kauṭilya Like many Indian philosophers, we don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Kauṭilya. His name literally means something like \u0026ldquo;the crooked one,\u0026rdquo; and this name fits well with the often amoral prescriptions of the text.\nThis crooked philosopher is also traditionally identified with the lawmaker Cāṇakya, who lived around 300 BCE, and was prime minister to Chandragupta, the founder of the Mauryan empire. However, both internal evidence from the text and archaeological evidence make this early dating unlikely. Things get more complicated still when the final verse of Arthaśāstra names a third author: Viṣṇugupta. Many have tried to argue that these three were one and the same. But it\u0026rsquo;s perhaps safer to assume that this text, like many Indian texts, was woven together from multiple threads, and the product of many hands.\nThe scholar and translator Patrick Olivelle argues there may have been a single writer, called Kauṭilya, who was responsible for the bulk of the text. Nevertheless, he says, the book can be understood as taking shape in three phases. First, there are the sources on which Kauṭilya drew. Then there is the original composition by Kauṭilya, or somebody we now call Kauṭilya. And finally, there is the later tradition of editorial redaction. But whatever the evolution of the text, it is likely that it reached something more or less like its present form between the first century BCE to the first century CE.\nThe Arthaśāstra was widely read and cited in Medieval India, but some time around the 12th century, it was lost. In the centuries after, it was known only from references in other texts and commentaries. It was only in the early 20th century that a complete manuscript fell into the hands of R. Shamasastry, the Librarian of the Government Oriental Library in Mysore. Shamasastry set about translating the text, publishing the first full translation into English in 1915.\nThe law of the fish The Arthaśāstra is a comprehensive manual for statecraft. It covers education, the training of ministers, and the roles of officials in charge of forestry, alcohol, abattoirs, and elephants. It deals with marriage law and inheritance, property rights and land disputes. It explores relations between states, war and peace, alliances and military strategy. It tells you how to build a good fort. It enumerates human vices. It advises on how to put down revolts. And it sets out a wealth of underhand strategies for gaining and maintaining power.\nIf there is a bigger background to this, it is a view of human life that the text calls the \u0026ldquo;law of the fish.\u0026rdquo; This law is simple in principle, even if it leads to all kinds of complexities: big fish eat little fish. This is taken by the Arthaśāstra as a basic fact of human society. The strong devour the weak. The weak are devoured by the strong.\nBodleian Library Oxford. CC By 4.0.

In terms of foreign policy, the difficulty is how to avoid being devoured by bigger fish who happen to be nearby. Or how to become the biggest fish in the pond, so you can devour others. But internally, the wise ruler should pay attention to the law of the fish as well.\nOne might think that in a fish-eat-fish world, the ruler could exert unlimited power over the bodies of their subjects, and just swim around gobbling everybody up. However, history and experience show that things are always more complicated. If a ruler abuses their power beyond breaking-point, their subjects may embark on collective action. And although one big fish may eat many small fish, the reverse is also true: many small fish can, working together, devour one big fish. So, the trick is to control one\u0026rsquo;s subjects as much as one can, but not going so far as to incite revolt.\nIn this task, one of the most important tools available to a ruler (or a high-ranking baboon) is punishment — or, as Mark McClish puts it in his study of the Arthaśāstra, \u0026ldquo;constructive coercion.\u0026rdquo; This, however, is a ticklish business: in making sure that coercion is constructive, the ruler has to tread a careful line. Overly severe punishment can be counter-productive and lead to rebellion. Conversely, if the power to punish is not grasped firmly enough, it can cause laxity and chaos. And this leaves the way open for other potential big fish to throw their weight around, as can be seen in the following passage from the text (all quotes come from Olivelle 2013).\nWhen [punishment] is dispensed improperly, whether in passion or anger or through contempt, it incites even forest hermits and wandering ascetics to revolt; how much more, then, the house- holders! When one fails to dispense it, on the other hand, it gives rise to the law of the fish—for in the absence of the dispenser of punishment, a weak man is devoured by a stronger man\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; (1.5.5, p. 69.)\nThis leads to a kind of social contract theory. The Arthaśāstra says it is precisely because people were oppressed by this law of the fish that they elected the first king, Manu. They tithed him one-sixth of their grain and one-tenth of their merchandise. And in return, Manu ensured there was some breathing space. The war of all against all was held in abeyance, and the weak were protected. \u0026ldquo;Punishment,\u0026rdquo; the text says, \u0026ldquo;when it has training as its foundation, provides enterprise and security to living beings.\u0026rdquo; (ibid.)\nThe training of a king The emphasis on training is central here. Arbitrary and unrestrained use of punishment is not going to serve the interests of the ruler. And the Arthaśāstra makes clear a good ruler needs to underpin their rule with extensive knowledge—of philosophy, of the Vedas or religious texts, of elephants, horses, chariots, and weapons—and with a mastery of their mind and of their senses. An ill-trained ruler is a bad ruler.\nThe most fundamental aspect of the training of a ruler, the text says, is not book learning, or knowledge of strategy. It is this training of the senses. If you are unrestrained in the use of your senses, you will fail as a ruler. You will become dissolute, you will slacken your vigilance, and this will lead to others exploiting your weakness.\nIn case the point isn\u0026rsquo;t driven home with sufficient force, the text helpfully goes on to list some examples of those rulers who, unrestrained in their senses, were brought to their senses sharply by their enemies. After enumerating a series of cases of rulers running riot, the text says:\nThese and many other kings, addicted to the set of six enemies and not having mastered their senses, came to ruin along with their kinsmen and kingdoms. (1.7.1 p. 71)\nThe Arthaśāstra acknowledges that the ruler can and should pursue pleasure. It is, after all, one of the benefits of being in charge: think of Logan Roy in Succession flying around on his private jet, hanging out on his private yacht, or enjoying fine dining. But this pleasure is much more circumscribed than those without power might imagine, because it may only be pursued to the point that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t transgress either law or success. And of these three — pleasure, law, and success — the Arthaśāstra says that it is the last that is paramount. Without success, there can be no law and no pleasure. When the regime is no longer effective, the whole thing falls apart, and along with it, the possibility of pleasure that power provides.\nThe underhand game of politics One way the ruler can keep their pleasures in check is by appointing good ministers. A good minister can not only carry out the ruler\u0026rsquo;s desires, but they can also keep these desires in check and warn when they are tending towards excess. But this raises a further question: how do you choose somebody who is not themselves a power-hungry scoundrel?\nHere, the Arthaśāstra\u0026rsquo;s advice is to subject potential ministers to secret tests of loyalty, to tricks and ruses—and to see how well they fare. By tempting your ministers into wrong-doing, you can winnow out those who are not incorruptible. Those who hold firm are likely to be trustworthy.\nThis theme of underhand tactics — the trick, the ruse, the secret test — recurs throughout the text. If it is done right, statecraft, according to the Arthaśāstra, is inherently underhand. Not only should the ruler be underhand in how they select their ministers, they should also put in place a whole network of underhand operatives to keep control of their empire.\nWith the body of ministers, whose integrity has been proven by secret tests, in place, he should commission clandestine operatives: crafty students, apostate recluses, and agents working undercover as householders, merchants, or ascetics, as well as secret agents, assassins, poisoners, and female mendicant agents. (1.11.19 p. 76-7)\nThe Arthaśāstra is a riot of sneaky ruses: from fomenting dissent, to handing out secret punishments; from poisonings to sexual manipulation; from appeals to vanity to disguising assassins as potential lovers; and from the exploitation of difference and discord to the use of magical arts. Pretty much everything is fair game, if it leads to success and thus also ensures the continuation of law and pleasure.\nFinding a space for ethics It is hardly surprising, as McClish writes, that this unabashed emphasis on \u0026ldquo;duplicity, violence, and opportunism\u0026rdquo; made the Arthaśāstra a controversial text. Where is the room for ethics? What about virtue?\nBut before leaping to the assumption that the Arthaśāstra is completely opposed to morality, we need to set this emphasis on secrecy and sneakiness against the earlier material on training and restraint of the senses. The concerns of the text are certainly more pragmatic than moral, but they are not entirely divorced from morality. Morality is one aspect — and a vitally important one — of the pragmatic calculus in which the ruler must engage. Pragmatically speaking, there can be no taking leave of morality. If you are seen to be rapacious yourself, or if you let others run riot, then there is only so long people will put up with you as a ruler.\nSo here is a moral that would-be Logan Roys would do well to take on board: from a pragmatic point of view, people in general demand a certain level of morality. And an effective, or successful, ruler ignores this fact at their peril.\nFurther Reading Mark McClish and Patrick Olivelle\u0026rsquo;s The Arthaśāstra, Selections from the Classic Indian Work on Statecraft (Hackett 2012) is a great introduction to the text.\nFor a more complete scholarly account, try Patrick Olivelle\u0026rsquo;s King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India (Oxford University Press 2013).\nAlso well worth reading is Mark McClish\u0026rsquo;s The History of the Arthaśāstra: Sovereignty and Sacred Law in Ancient India (Cambridge University Press 2019).\nFinally, have a read of this piece on Han Feizi, to see how similar concerns played out in the context of ancient China.\nImage: Portuguese image of an Indian war elephant, c. 1540.

            "content": "Time for a Change It\u0026rsquo;s been two years since I started Looking for Wisdom, along with my Wind\u0026amp;Bones collaborator, Hannah Stevens. We set up the site when deep in the middle of Covid lockdown in Sofia, Bulgaria. We had time on our hands, the world seemed even more deeply puzzling than usual (as Aristotle points out in the Metaphysics, wonder or thaumazein is often a spur to philosophising), and we thought it would be fun to set up a philosophy newsletter.\nSince then, we have published hundreds of thousands of words, and built up a community of hundreds of philosophers from across the world. It has been a blast. But we\u0026rsquo;ve been increasingly aware that we need to make some changes.\nEarlier this year, we moved our base from Sofia to Dundee in Scotland, where we re-established Wind\u0026amp;Bones as a Scottish non-profit social enterprise. As the newly reshaped Wind\u0026amp;Bones took off, we started running a whole bunch of fun projects. And we found that there simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite so much time to write Looking for Wisdom. Not only this, but over the previous two years, Looking for Wisdom had run at a magnificent loss. Financially, we knew we couldn\u0026rsquo;t sustain this forever. The attempts we had made to monetise Looking for Wisdom had been decidedly half-hearted.\nWhen it came down to it, we simply didn\u0026rsquo;t want to turn readers and friends into long-term customers. So we realised it was time to take a step back to have a rethink, to see how we could integrate Looking for Wisdom more closely into our work at Wind\u0026amp;Bones.\nWind\u0026amp;Bones is about writing, creativity and social change. We have always felt Looking for Wisdom fits snugly within this brief. So we asked ourselves what the things are that we value about Looking for Wisdom. And we came up with the following list.\nLooking for Wisdom is a growing body of freely-available resources online. Looking for Wisdom is a community of philosophers. Looking for Wisdom is a potential starting point for fun and interesting projects. The last of these is particularly close to our hearts. We really love running projects. We like finding ourselves in a room somewhere in the world (whether an actual room, or a virtual one) connecting with new people, exchanging ideas and insights, and together trying to conjure something good and valuable. Not only this, but projects are our bread-and-butter. They give us the income that keeps food on the table, so we can go on doing good things.\nAfter some discussion, we decided our strategy should be this:\nRebuild the website to make it sustainable long-term. Relaunch the newsletter so it is more independent of the website content. Think about how we can branch out into developing philosophy projects. So that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;re doing! The website has been redesigned from the ground up. We have a brand new newsletter. And we\u0026rsquo;re putting a lot of energy into coming up with new projects.\nRebuilding the website Rebuilding the site was the biggest challenge. From the beginning, Looking for Wisdom was run using Ghost, which is an exceptionally elegant newsletter platform.\nGhost served our needs well for a couple of years. But unless you run Ghost as a paid newsletter, the costs can mount up. So we decided to switch to a static website: essentially, this is just a bunch of web-pages without any database shenanigans in the background keeping things ticking over. We\u0026rsquo;re a big fan of static websites. They are fast, they are secure, and they are robust.\nFor those who have an interest in the technical behind-the-scenes stuff, the new version of Looking for Wisdom is built using Hugo, the static site generator. We transferred everything over from Ghost using Joshua Barone\u0026rsquo;s handy ghostToHugo script, which almost worked (or well enough to get started). Then we dived in and tidied up the code, made sure that the hyperlinks had all carried across properly, fixed any broken links, triple-checked the images, and squashed a few stray typos and inconsistencies. As for the site theme, we\u0026rsquo;re using a lightly-modified version of the Hilton theme. The theme didn\u0026rsquo;t come with a built-in search function, so we added our own search page, using a bit of JavaScript magic, thanks to the incredibly useful guide written by Victoria Drake. Once we update the site locally, we then push the updates to GitHub, and the site is served via Netlify. It\u0026rsquo;s like magic!\nThe resulting website is at least as pretty as before. It also doesn\u0026rsquo;t depend on having a database to keep it running. Instead, all the content is kept in Markdown files, which makes it incredibly easy to handle. And, even better, it costs almost nothing to keep it running!\nNow that we\u0026rsquo;ve made these changes, we\u0026rsquo;ve got lots of new content in the works. So we\u0026rsquo;re going to keep updating the website over the coming months and years, but on a slightly less demanding schedule than before.\nRelaunching the newsletter Until now at Looking for Wisdom, when we posted new content on the site, by default it would automatically go out to subscribers. But for this relaunch, we wanted to separate out the website and the newsletter, recognising that websites and newsletters are different kinds of beasts. We\u0026rsquo;re using the website for more enduring content, and the newsletter for more fleeting, time-sensitive content.\nEnter your email Emails sent using Buttondown newsletter. You can unsubscribe at any time. The newsletter now runs using Buttondown. We love their ethos, the price is great, deliverability is excellent, and we can write our newsletters in Markdown. The overall cost is $90 a year, which is pretty much our only ongoing running cost. If you are a subscriber, you will have already been moved over to the new newsletter. If not, you can sign up here.\nFinally, there\u0026rsquo;s no paid subscription tier any more. But if you appreciate the newsletter and want to donate to what we do at Looking for Wisdom / Wind\u0026amp;Bones, you have that option. There\u0026rsquo;s no suggested donation: it\u0026rsquo;s entirely up to you!\nProjects, projects, projects\u0026hellip; All of this frees us up to think more about projects. We have a few things in the works. In February, we\u0026rsquo;re running a session with the brilliant Premise Institute over in Portland, Oregon, talking about strangers, philosophy and the art of connection.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re also just about to announce a project that is close to our heart, which will bring together literature and philosophy, and writers from China and the UK. This is super-exciting, but is currently embargoes. So more on this in January! And more recently, we\u0026rsquo;ve started talking with friends from a brilliant organisation in Edinburgh about running some face-to-face sessions on philosophy for social change down there.\nSumming up\u0026hellip; So that\u0026rsquo;s where we are! We hope you like the new look. We\u0026rsquo;re delighted with it, and confident that in this way, Looking for Wisdom can continue to thrive long into the future.\n",

            "content": "Looking for Wisdom Interview: Comics artist and writer Barbara Stok talks about dogs, Cynics, philosophers, and the art of living. Here at Looking for Wisdom, we’ve long been fascinated by the Cynic philosopher Hipparchia. So we were wildly excited when we stumbled across Dutch comic artist Barbara Stok’s sublime The Philosopher, the Dog and the Wedding.\nThe book is a beautiful and meticulously researched graphic novel that reimagines Hipparchia’s life, and explores what we might learn from it. First published in Dutch, The Philosopher, the Dog and the Wedding is now available in English translation from Self Made Hero. It is a delight from the first page to the last. And it touches on deep philosophical questions with enormous charm and a lightness of touch.\nA couple of weeks back, we caught up with Barbara to talk about philosophy, dogs, gender, comics, cynicism both contemporary and modern, and what we might learn from ancient philosophy\nBarbara Stok (Image © Barbara Stok)\nQ1: Hello, Barbara! Great to meet you. First off, we’d love to know what first attracted you to Hipparchia.*\nHi Will, great to meet a fellow Cynics enthusiast. I’ve been interested in philosophy for over 20 years, I took up classes at university. And Stoicism has become an important part of my life. When I was in my 30s my husband Ricky and I wanted to have children, but that didn’t work out. The Stoics helped me get over the grief. Since then, I still do Stoic exercises regularly to get peace of mind about daily irritations and such.\nSo after I finished my graphic novel Vincent, about Vincent van Gogh, it was logical to me to choose a philosopher as my next subject. In a book about women philosophers I found Hipparchia. I had never heard of her, but her story immediately appealed to me. I knew right away I wanted to make a story about her.\nThat the Cynics were the predecessors of the Stoics I only discovered when I was already working on this book. I had applied for funding and got to work, for starters by reading about it. Only then did I discover that the Cynic Crates was the teacher of Zeno, the founder of the Stoics. Makes sense in retrospect because the ideas are very related, which was precisely why I was attracted to the Cynics.\nThe Greek for “Cynics” —* Κυνικοί *— means “those who are like dogs.” The term was originally an insult directed at the founder of the school, Diogenes of Sinope. But Diogenes and his followers made it their own. After all, they argued, dogs are better at understanding the art of living than their human companions. You are a dog person yourself, and throughout your book there are countless dogs, going about their doggy lives. So, as a modern-day fan of Hipparchia and the Cynics, what do you think we can learn from dogs about the arts of living?\nWe had a dog, called Wisky. I learned a lot from her about taking it easy, being in the here and now, and accepting the situation as it is.\nWisky died when I was about halfway working on the book. Her death affected me tremendously, much more than I expected. She had lived with us for twelve years, she was a family member, a friend. For two whole months I was unable to work. This made me think about the millions of animals killed every month here in The Netherlands in the meat industry. Those animals are all individuals, just like our dog. Pigs are even more intelligent than dogs and very social. But no one mourns their deaths like we mourned Wisky. This realisation was the last straw for me to become a vegetarian.\nThe Cynics radically questioned the cultural norms of their day: ideas about right and wrong, and about how we ought to live. They aimed to return to a more natural way of living, free of the complications of the culture into which they were born. Is this challenge to live more naturally one that can still speak to us today?\nAbsolutely! I think we too need to radically question our cultural norms and conventions. I think our society is all wrong. Many people in Europe live a comfortable life of luxury, but it\u0026rsquo;s at the expense of others. Slavery still exists today, animals are used as if they are objects, and we are the cause of the climate crisis, of course. I admire the Cynics because they rigorously renounced the whole system: property, social ranks, national borders. The Cynics say: these are all illusions. They advocated a simpler lifestyle and a principle of equality of everyone. I hope Hipparchia and Crates will be a source of inspiration for people to make different choices.\nHipparchia © Barbara Stok\nAs a woman philosopher, Hipparchia offers a particularly powerful critique of the gendered norms of her own time. In what ways are her insights into gender still relevant today? Do we still need modern-day Hipparchias to shake us up and force us to question our assumptions around gender?\nI received a response from a reader, a woman who was a refugee from the Middle East. She was very touched by the book because women in her home country nowadays still live exactly as Hipparchia did. But here in Europe also, there are still so many persistent ideas about how women should be and how men should be. Women are caring, men are tough, you name it all. Get rid of it! I have never identified with the stereotypical image of women, and it bothers me.\nI would like everyone to have the freedom to do and behave and dress exactly the way they want. If you are in a privileged position you can stand up against the norms to some extent, but a lot of people don\u0026rsquo;t have that freedom. If you are a woman struggling to get by, and you go to a job interview of a job that you really need, it is almost mandatory to wear makeup, for example. For many people, it\u0026rsquo;s very hard not to conform to the social rules.\nWorking space. Photo © Barbara Stok.\nAt any time in writing the book, were you yourself tempted to leave home, and become a modern-day Cynic philosopher? If not, in what other ways has spending five years thinking about and researching Hipparchia and the Cynics transformed your own life?\nDuring the making of the book I thought about that, to try living on the streets, even if only for a few days. To better understand what that was like for Hipparchia and Crates. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it. Apparently, that\u0026rsquo;s a huge step. The Cynics did not think that everyone should live exactly like them though. For the Cynics it was more about the change in attitude.\nThey certainly changed my attitude. When I have a decision to make, I often think: what would Hipparchia and Crates have done? I live in a small house, I got rid of the car, I buy as little stuff as possible, almost no new clothes any more.\nSometimes I do find this to be a struggle because in this world we are bombarded with the capitalist values of buy this, buy that. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to get sucked into that. But if you go along with it, it\u0026rsquo;s a bottomless pit, it never ends. Even if you have a big house and everything, you will still think: it would be nice if we had a swimming pool indoors. There\u0026rsquo;s always more you can want.\nThe final two spreads of your book offer a challenge to your reader to think about how we live now. Suddenly, we are no longer on the hillsides of Ancient Greece. Instead, we find ourselves landed back here in the present, in the thick of things: laptops, delivery drivers, police officers, Armani suits, parasols, sports cars with belching exhausts, clocks, perfumes, briefcases, air conditioning…\nAnd yet, if we look closely the dogs are still there, doing their thing, just as they always have done. So is it harder in the present to become a Cynic than it was in Ancient Greece? Or, following the example of the dogs, is it just as easy as it ever was, if only we have the will or the desire?\nWell, on the one hand I think it was more difficult for Hipparchia because in Ancient Greece women were legally considered inferior and treated as minors. At the time, what she did was downright shocking and really dangerous. So Hipparchia must have been extremely brave. Life was harsher. Famine, exile, hanging - these were real dangers.\nOn the other hand, it was easier for them to find food in nature because there was more wild nature altogether that nobody owned. Nowadays, it is difficult to break away from the system we are in. We need money even for the bare minimal necessities of life. We even have to pay for water.\nOne of the things that we found most enchanting about your book was the attention to detail. There is so much warmth, and so much meticulous care in your depictions of daily life in Ancient Greece. Can you say a bit more about your research process when writing this book?\nWhile working on this graphic novel, many times I thought: what have I gotten myself into? I went through so much documentation. Ricky and I travelled to Greece to get an idea of the vegetation, the landscape, the colours. When I finally started drawing, with every picture I came up against questions: what did that look like? What did the houses look like? What kind of transportation did they have? What approaches to timekeeping did they have? What kind of life did the women have? I had to find out every detail about daily life in antiquity. Gradually, I created their world completely in my head — and Hipparchia and Crates came to life.\nFinally, we’d love to know if you have any more philosophical projects in the works? Can we look forward to a growing library of Barbara Stok comics introducing us to history’s overlooked women philosophers?\nYes, I am planning to make another book about a philosopher. Not necessarily a female philosopher, but I\u0026rsquo;d rather not reveal more yet because it\u0026rsquo;s still an early stage. Anyway, there is always a philosophical layer in my stories, also in the graphic novel about Vincent van Gogh and in my autobiographical comics.\nThank you, Barbara! We can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see what you publish next.\nAbout Barbara Stok Barbara Stok is an award-winning graphic novelist from The Netherlands.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Love, Strife and The Mad Machinery of War In his great poem, On the Nature of the Universe (De Rerum Natura), Roman poet-philosopher Lucretius (born c. 100 BCE) asks what it means to live fully in a world where everything is always in motion. A follower of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, Lucretius proposed that the universe was both dynamic and unstable. But as well as setting out a vision of physics, or how the world is, Lucretius also set out a compelling vision of what it means to live in such a world.\nEthics appears right at the beginning of On the Nature of the Universe, when Lucretius sings the praises of the goddess Venus. He conjures up the image of the struggle between Venus and Mars, between love and strife. Lucretius offers up a prayer to the Goddess (in the brilliant translation by Alicia Stallings) as follows:\nBoth on dry land and on the deep, Make the mad machinery of war drift off to sleep. For only you can favour mortal men with peace, since Mars, Mighty in Arms, who oversees the wicked works of wars, Conquered by Love’s everlasting wound, so often lies Upon your lap, and gazing upwards, feasts his greedy eyes On love, his mouth agape at you, Famed Goddess, as he tips Back his shapely neck, his breath hovering at your lips.\\\n(Book I: 37)\nThis theme of the struggle between love and strife goes back to the philosopher Empedocles, for whom the universe could be seen as existing in a constant dialogue between forces of attraction and repulsion, between binding together and severing apart.\nLucretius\u0026rsquo;s initial invocation of this struggle between love and strife is not just a bit of fancy literary footwork. It also goes to the heart of his atomist view of the world: atoms combine into bigger bodies, and these bodies break apart. All things come into existence and crumble away again through the combination, recombination and eventual separation of atoms.\nBoth of these things — love and strife, combination and separation — are necessary to existence. If things just clumped into larger and larger entities, then the universe would simply collapse together into a single, undifferentiated mass. But if they didn\u0026rsquo;t combine at all, nothing would happen, there would be no universe at all. So for Lucretius, both these processes are necessary: uniting and severing, coming together and breaking apart, Venus and Mars.\nBut for Lucretius, what is crucial is the question of who has the upper hand. If we focus on division, on severing, on separating out, then the mad machinery of war clanks into action, and we will never know peace. But if we allow our divisiveness to relax a little, and see the opportunities that Venus offers — the fact that the world always offers new creations, new possibilities — then there is the prospect of a more peaceful existence.\nCutting Loose from Religion For Lucretius — as for his inspiration, Epicurus — there is a direct line from his physics of atoms and void to his view of ethics. Lucretius claims that the world is an inherently turbulent place. It is perpetually in motion, always unstable, liable to change at any time. But our ethical codes are often inadequate when it comes to responding to living in this changeable world.\nHere, Lucretius — the same Lucretius who begins by evoking Venus and Mars — singles out religion as a particularly ineffective way of responding to the mutability of the world. Religion, he says bluntly, “breeds wickedness” (Book I: 80). Through religion, we conjure up ideas of virtue and vice, and we live in accord with these ideas: but these abstractions can lead us to terrible acts.\nFor evidence, Lucretius cites the case of Iphigenia, the daughter of Agamemnon, who is sacrificed by her father so that the Greeks can have favourable winds to speed their ships towards Troy. Here is the way Lucretius tells the story:\nAs soon as they bound the fillet round her hair\nSo that its ends streamed down her cheeks, the girl became aware\nThat waiting at the temple for her there would be no groom –\nInstead she saw her father with a countenance of gloom\nAttended by the priests who kept the blade well hid. The sight\nOf people shedding tears to see her froze her tongue with fright.\nShe sank to the ground upon her knees. It did not mean a thing\nFor the princess now, that she had been the first to give the king\nThe name of Father. No, for shaking, the poor girl was carried\nBy the hands of men up to the altar, not that she be married\nWith solemn ceremony, to the accompanying strain\nOf loud-sung bridal hymns, but as a maiden, pure of stain,\nTo be impurely slaughtered, at the age when she should wed,\nSorrowful sacrifice slain at her father’s hand instead.\nAll this for fair and favourable winds to sail the fleet along! –\nSo potent was Religion in persuading to do wrong.\\\n(Book I: 85-101)\nFor Lucretius, this is an example of how — if we ignore the world, and turn to abstractions for ethical guidance — we risk ending up doing terrible things. So part of the task Lucretius sets himself is that of freeing us from the “tight strictures of religion” (Book I: 930), and he wants us to look in a different direction for our ideas of ethics.\nTracing the Flights of the Swallow: From Physics to Ethics Swallows, by Utagawa Hiroshige, mid 1840s. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nSo Lucretius sets about rebuilding an ethics that is an adequate response to the fact that we live in a world in motion. Through doing this, he hopes, it might be possible to find a way to live well among this great hubbub of love and strife. Or, even more precisely, it might be possible to find a way to move well through this great hubbub.\nIn some ways Lucretius is a faithful follower of Epicurus: he takes on board Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s physics of atoms and void, his critique of religion, and his ideas about the harms caused by our fear of death. But in other ways, he departs from Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s teachings. Lucretius is a much more dynamic thinker than Epicurus. the Epicurean ideal of ataraxia is of a kind of stillness, but Lucretius seeks instead something like an ideal kind of motion.\nAt one point in his poem, Lucretius compares Epicurus to a swan, and himself to a swallow. This may seem like a nice piece of self-deprecation. Swallows were associated in the ancient world with prophecy. They were representations of rebirth, of desire, and of spring. They were associated with Venus. So Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s identification with the swallow isn\u0026rsquo;t quite so humble as it might first seem. But there is something else going on as well. In the last piece on Lucretius, we saw how the clinamen — the swerve of an atom, the deep-rooted unpredictability of things — is central to Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s physics. And there is no bird that swerves with as much panache as a swallow. In his book on Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s ethics, Thomas Nail writes about how the image of the swallow fits Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s physics of swerving atoms perfectly:\nSwallows are known above all for their chaotic and unpredictable flight paths as they hunt insects in mid-air. Swallows spiral, circle, dive, and make sharp turns and twists that few other birds can manage. Since humans cannot see these insects, it looks as though the swallows are moving ‘randomly’, when in fact their erratic-looking movements are the result of a highly relational and responsive entanglement with their prey. (p.22)\nLucretius\u0026rsquo;s ethics is a sensual, embodied ethics of movement. And it is hard to imagine a more beautiful image of what it might be to move, to swoop — with skill and suppleness — through this turbulent world.\nMovement and Oppression For Lucretius, then, ethics, is about what we do and how we move. Ethics is something to be lived as an embodied being, rather than something to be simply theorised.\nBut what, more precisely, makes an action ethical for Lucretius? One answer is that unethical action is action that works against this ability to move, that involves the stopping up of life, or risks falling into a kind of stasis that makes everything rigid, and renders us unresponsive to the world, to each other, and to what our own bodies are telling us.\nAnd here, Lucretius makes the startling claim that power is one of the main ways that life can be stopped up. Although power can often seem to offer us more possibilities for movement, as often as not, it simply calcifies us. It makes us less supple and rigid, and risks bringing both ourselves, and those over whom we wield this power, closer to death. Here is what Lucretius writes:\nTake Avarice and the blind drive of Ambition:both may draw\nWretched men to step outside the limits of the law –\nOften even as partners and accomplices in crime –\nAs each man, day and night, strives harder than the next to climb\nAtop the pyramid of power. It is largely the dread\nOf death on which these open wounds of life thrive and are fed,\nFor Vile Disgrace and Bitter Want seem so far from the state\nOf a sweet, established life, they almost loiter at Death’s gate. (Book III: 59-65)\nPower is a kind of death. It removes our ability — and removes the ability of others — to move freely, in response to this changing world.\nTake many of the ethical issues that face us, and you can see what is at stake is this stopping-up of movement, this calcification. Why are things as diverse as slavery, poverty, oppression, and battery farming bad? The Lucretian answer to this question is that these are all ways in which the swoop and surge of life is restricted. They are all ways of stopping-up our natural power of movement, imposing restrictions on the fullness of life. They are all things that stand in the way of the responsive, relational entanglement with the world that is the sign of a life in motion, and the hallmark of a life fully lived.\nFurther Reading All the quotes from Lucretius come from Alicia Stallings\u0026rsquo; translation, Lucretius: The Nature of Things (Penguin 2007).

            "content": "Philosophers Behaving Badly? The philosopher Simone de Beauvoir was a big fan of philosophising while drunk. Along with her sidekick Jean Paul Sartre, De Beauvoir partied hard, with the full commitment you might expect given her existentialist tendencies. In this, she was part of a long tradition of philosophers who drink. This tradition is so well established that the bar-room philosopher has become a stock figure in popular mythology: the drunken rambler who lists across the room and corners you for a conversation about how you can be certain that the tables and chairs in the bar really exist.\nBut for all those philosophers who are partial to a tipple, others are more uneasy with drunkenness. Immanuel Kant — who in his younger days was known to drink so much he couldn\u0026rsquo;t find his way home — argued that drinking to excess makes human beings little better than animals, although he permitted mild inebriation for the sake of warmer social connections (what constitutes “mild”, of course, is a matter of fine judgement). And Socrates managed to somehow get the best of both worlds. He was the most sober of drunks, who could drink everybody under the table, without ever showing signs of loss of control.\nSo when you are next inclined towards philosophy, should you crack open a can of beer, an amphora of wine, or a cask of whiskey? Or should you abstain? Fortunately, Plato is here to guide you through the issues involved.\nDrinking to Get Drunk With the Greek Philosophers In Ancient Greece, one of the main places where philosophy took place was at symposia. These were drinking parties where (almost exclusively male, although see this excellent attempt at gatecrashing from the philosopher Hipparchia) philosophers hung out and talked a combination of sense and nonsense into the early hours. As Plato put it, passing time in conversation and drinking (as long as we conduct ourselves well) is a considerable contribution to education. How so? Because, as Sarah Mattice put it in her paper on drinking to get drunk in Greece and China, symposia were a form of training in controlled excess.\nThis is how Mattice describes a typical symposium, or philosophical drinking party.\nIn ancient Greece, symposia were a form of social gathering, centering on drinking wine, giving speeches, and playing various kinds of games. Although flute-girls and serving girls might be present for some of the evening, the participants were traditionally male citizens or men of equal status. The men would lounge on couches placed in a square, around which the wine mixture was passed in a ritual fashion. The symposiarch, or leader of the symposium, was responsible for mixing the wine to determine its strength and deciding on the topic of conversation. [1]\nGuests at the symposium would take turns making speeches, singing songs, bragging, or philosophising out loud. And when the evening was done, they\u0026rsquo;d sometimes spill out into the street in a komos, or a drunken riot.\nDrunkenness and the Law But what good, philosophical reasons might there be for this behaviour? To answer this, we can turn to Plato\u0026rsquo;s Laws, his longest, and perhaps least-loved book. The Laws is a somewhat rambling account of a conversation that takes place in Crete. The three participants in the conversation are a stranger from Athens (known only as “the Athenian”), a Spartan called Megillus, and a Cretan called Kleinias.\nThe three men are talking about how to establish laws that can govern a new state called Magnesia. You might think a discussion of law would begin by asking about law itself, about what law is, or what makes something lawful. But instead, the very first book of the Laws launches into a discussion of drunkenness.\nWhy start in such an odd place? Plato makes clear that this choice of starting point is not arbitrary. Instead, the question of drunkenness and how to manage it is vital to thinking through what civilisation and law are about.\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s speak at greater length about the whole subject of intoxication. It is not a practice of minor significance, and to understand it is not the part of any paltry lawgiver. I\u0026rsquo;m speaking now, not about the drinking or non- drinking of wine in general, but about getting drunk. (Laws 637d) [2]\nWhy is drunkenness such a big deal? In part, it is because it brings to light the unruliness of human passion. And this unruliness is one of the biggest issues when it comes to establishing some kind of law or common measure in society.\nGiddy Goats In the face of this unruliness, it might be tempting to abolish drunkenness altogether. This is what the austere Spartan Megillus recommends. But Plato thinks we should take more seriously the up-sides of drunkenness, and we should find ways of permitting a controlled unruliness for the greater social good. And his argument proceeds by means of an analogy with goats.\nAmos and Three Goats. 13th Century. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nImagine, the Athenian stranger in the Laws says, that somebody sees a herd of well-governed goats. Seeing how orderly the goats are, this person decides that goats in general are admirable beasts, and that raising goats is an excellent pursuit. Now imagine somebody else sees another herd of goats, but this second herd is not under the government of a good goat-herd. Unsurprisingly, this second person decides that goats are agents of chaos, worthy of our highest disdain.\nNow imagine these two goat-observers falling into conversation. They start discussing the merits or demerits of goats, and they cannot agree. But what Plato wants us to see is that the issue is not really whether goats are good or bad. A goat is a goat is a goat: it is simply a thing in the world that requires careful management. So rather than thinking about whether we should praise or blame goats, invite them into our lives or abolish them, Plato wants us to think instead about how goats are governed.\nSo it is with the question of drunkenness. For Plato, what is at issue is not whether drunkenness is good or bad in itself. Instead, the issue is how we govern and manage it. And here, it becomes clear that the problems and opportunities presented by drunkenness have a common source: the fact that drunkenness amplifies everything. Drunkenness is an emotional megaphone.\nIn the Laws, Plato asks, “Doesn\u0026rsquo;t the drinking of wine make pleasures, pains, the spirited emotions, and the erotic emotions, more intense?” (Laws 645d). And because of this heightening of the emotions, drunkenness often diminishes our capacity for prudence (Laws 645d-e). It makes people such as magistrates, pilots and judges incompetent in the performance of their duties (Laws 674b). Plato even goes so far as to worry that drunken procreative sex (when the drinker is “raging with frenzy in body and soul”) is liable to lead to unfortunate, malformed, or ethically defective offspring (Laws 775 c-d).\nBut before we abolish drunkenness altogether, like the Spartan Megillus, Plato argues that drinking to excess also has its benefits, if it is managed properly. Well-governed drunkenness can increase social bonds (Laws 671e), it can heal the austerity of old age (Laws 666b), and it can make the soul softer, more pliable, leading to the possibility of its rejuvenation (Laws 666c).\nWine Drinking in a Spring Garden. Persian painting c. 1430. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nHerding Goats and Philosophers So when is it good to be drunk, and when is it not? Under what circumstances can drinking help you become a better philosopher, or a wiser human?\nPlato recognises that while drunk, drinkers are at risk of all kinds of ignobility, brashness and rudeness. But if, like those rowdy goats, the drunk can be managed by a good goat-herd, a lawgiver, then their dispositions can be better shaped and transformed. After all, when it comes to philosophy, having a pliable, malleable soul can be of some benefit. When drunk, the soul is made soft. This makes it amenable to being better shaped and moulded into new forms, just as warmed or molten metal can be shaped by a skilled metalsmith.\nDrinking, if done under the guidance of the sober and the wise, is like an alchemical laboratory for the human soul. It gives us the opportunity to get to grips with our emotions, our impulses, our pleasures and pains in raw form. And it allows us to develop greater self-control, as we wrestle these intense emotions into shape. As Sarah Mattice puts it:\nWith a sober symposiarch in the lead—monitoring the character of those involved—citizens are given the opportunity to test themselves against the desire to succumb to pleasures, at the very point when their self-control is at its lowest. By drinking wine and being present in a situation where shamelessness has a tendency to reign, the citizens can develop a resistance to immoderate behavior, and so develop their character. In addition, because for the Athenian, symposia would be civic events, they also provide the opportunity for the citizens’ virtue to be observed and tested. [3]\nDoing Philosophy While Drunk Good drunkenness, then, brings the passions to the surface. It allows us to connect with each other more deeply, more fiercely, and more fully. And if it is conducted under the auspices of a good guide, it is an education in combatting shamelessness, and in cultivating a proper sense of shame.\nHere, it is clear why Socrates is the perfect symposiarch: he can match everyone drink for drink, but he never loses his head. He can benefit from the benefits that drunkenness brings, the social heat that is cooked up by drinking together, but he doesn\u0026rsquo;t suffer from any of the down-sides. He is convivial but self-controlled.\nSo should you do philosophy while drunk? What benefits might this bring? And under what circumstances should you engage in unsober philosophy? If Plato is right (and Kant too, and also De Beauvoir), then a slug of whiskey or a carafe of wine might help in the collective pursuit of philosophy.\nBut here, it might be worth being cautious. This series, after all, is on reading philosophy, and not just on doing philosophy. So what about the solitary philosopher/drinker? Here, Plato would encourage caution. After all, as philosopher Edward Slingerland points out in his book Drunk: How We Sipped, Danced, and Stumbled Our Way to Civilisation:\nin most societies and for most of human history, the consumption of chemical intoxicants, especially alcohol, has been a fundamentally social act. In the vast majority of societies, no one drinks alone. [4]\nSo here the advice might be this: philosophise when drunk by all means. But if you want to derive benefit from drunken philosophy, you need to engage in it alongside others. Instead of reading in solitary silence, try reading your philosophy out loud, in the company of others, with a lot of riotous joking and discussion and banter, and see what benefits this brings to your reading, and to your life as a philosopher.\nHowever, here we need to ask one final question: what if you don\u0026rsquo;t drink? What about all those teetotal philosophers out there? Are you doomed to missing out/ Not necessarily! Because if what is most important here is the sense of boldness, the vivacity of emotion, what Plato might call the softness of the soul, and the sheer joy of being with others, then alcohol is not the end but a means. What matters most for doing philosophy, in this view, is conviviality, however you choose to cultivate it.\nSo this will be the topic of the next piece in this series: because for Plato, philosophy, like drinking, is a communal pursuit.\nRead the whole series on seven ways of reading philosophy\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "content": "The Philosopher and the Love Potion If you were to trust Saint Jerome – and you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t – the philosopher and poet Titus Lucretius Carus, better known simply as Lucretius, met an unfortunate end. The philosopher-poet was born some time after 100 BCE, a Roman citizen, and he became a follower of the atomism of Democritus and the materialist teachings of Epicurus, who emphasised the role of pleasure in human life. Lucretius died in his forties, leaving only one work behind: his great poetic treatise called On the Nature of the Universe (De Rerum Natura). Other than this, we know almost nothing about him.\nBut where the historical record is silent, Jerome happily steps in to provide some lurid tales of his own. According to Jerome, Lucretius drank a love potion that sent him mad. In brief moments of lucidity during his madness, Jerome tells us, Lucretius scribbled down his masterwork. And then, when he was done, he committed suicide.\nSaint Jerome in his study, thinking up mean things to say about Lucretius, while his lion (right) looks on. Public domain via Wellcome Collection.\nHoney on the Cup This story says more about Saint Jerome than about Lucretius himself. Because for Jerome, and for many later Christian writers, Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s decidedly this-worldly, materialistic philosophy of pleasure was pretty much the opposite of all their faith stood for.\nJerome\u0026rsquo;s scurrilous little tale is supposed to make us to imagine Lucretius as having both taken leave of his senses, and been overwhelmed by an unseemly passion. One reason that Jerome was so sternly disapproving was because of the particular charm of Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s writing. As a philosopher, Lucretius is seductive, in a way few philosophers are. He writes not in prose, but in verse. And although the vision he sets out of the universe is challenging, the way in which he presents it draws the reader in, sweetening the bitterness of philosophy with poetry. In On the Nature of the Universe, Lucretius explains his rationale like this (in the translation by Alicia Stallings).\nConsider a physician with a child who will not sip A disgusting dose of wormwood: first, he coats the goblet’s lip All round with honey’s sweet blond stickiness, that way to lure Gullible youth to taste it, and to drain the bitter cure, The child’s duped but not cheated – rather, put back in the pink – That’s what I do. Since those who’ve never tasted of it think This philosophy’s a bitter pill to swallow, and the throng Recoils, I wished to coat this physic in mellifluous song, To kiss it, as it were, with the sweet honey of the Muse. That is the purpose of my poetry, as you peruse My lines, to try to keep your mind’s attention, while you start To understand the framework at the universe’s heart. (936-950).\nAtoms, Void and Swerve Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s poem begins with a paean of praise to the goddess Venus, the personification of nature and of creativity, born of the froth and foam of the waves.\nLife-stirring Venus, Mother of Aeneas and of Rome, Pleasure of men and gods, you make all things beneath the dome Of sliding constellations teem, you throng the fruited earth And the ship-freighted sea – for every species comes to birth Conceived through you, and rises forth and gazes on the light. The winds flee from you, Goddess, your arrival puts to flight The clouds of heaven. For you, the crafty earth contrives sweet flowers, For you, the oceans laugh, the skies grow peaceful after showers, Awash with light\u0026hellip; (1-10)\nThis lush, rich evocation of the surging abundance of the world soon gives way to a rather more austere picture, deriving ultimately from Democritus, in which the universe is made up of atoms and void. Lucretius images a waterfall of atoms streaming downwards through the void on account of their weight, a constant rain of matter. This makes Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s universe (unlike that of Aristotle) one in which motion, not rest, is primary. The world, even at the simplest level, is dynamic.\nBut a universe in which there is nothing besides a dreary rain of atoms, falling in parallel through the void, is not a universe where anything particularly interesting can happen. So Lucretius introduces another element that is both intriguing and also controversial to the point of scandal. What, he says, if you introduce a bit of indeterminacy into the system? What if you allow one of these falling atoms to swerve, ever so little?\nAnother basic principle you need to have a sound Understanding of: when bodies fall through empty space Straight down, under their own weight, at a random time and place, They swerve a little. Just enough of a swerve for you to call It a change of course. Unless inclined to swerve, all things would fall Right through the deep abyss like drops of rain. There would be no Collisions, and no atom would meet atom with a blow, And Nature thus could not have fashioned anything, full stop. (216-223)\nSwerving Suggestion Throughout history, this idea of a “swerve”, or a clinamen, has been widely derided. As Andrew Pyle puts it, in his book Atomism and its Critics, “The doctrine of the ‘swerve’ was, of course, ridiculed in antiquity as a mere subterfuge, an ad hoc hypothesis invented to save free will.” Pyle\u0026rsquo;s “of course” suggests that he agrees with this assessment: that the clinamen is an inept attempt to rescue the possibility of genuine choice in a universe that is fully determined.\nBut if you read Lucretius closely, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be what he is up to. When he introduces the idea of the clinamen, Lucretius makes a bigger claim on its behalf. The clinamen is not necessary for there to be free will. Instead, it is necessary for there to be anything at all. Without the swerve, atoms wouldn\u0026rsquo;t clump and combine, objects wouldn\u0026rsquo;t interact, there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any beings for whom free will was even an issue, and the universe would be an endless, dreary stream of atoms, going on forever.\nIn other words, first and foremost, Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s swerve is about physics, not freedom. Only once those atoms falling through space are capable of a swerve is there the possibility that they may collide, spin off in unpredictable directions, clump together, form themselves into larger and larger bodies… The clinamen is not a way of patching physics to make room for free will. It is an attempt to argue that without a grain of indeterminacy, the world simply wouldn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nOn Free Will and Whimsy Nevertheless, Lucretius does have something to say about free will. He is the first thinker in the Western tradition to use the term “free will,” and in doing so, he refers directly to the swerve or the clinamen. But his view is much more subtle than the view usually attributed to him. He begins off by linking free will with a kind of internal agency—an inbuilt whimsicality.\nWhere does that freewill come from that exists in every creature The world over? Where do we get that freewill, wrenched away From the fates, by which we each proceed to follow pleasure’s sway, So that we swerve our motions not at a designated spot And fixed time, but the very place we will it in our thought? Without a doubt these motions have their beginning in the whims Of each, and from that Will these motions trickle into the limbs. [253-259]\nOur whims cause us to swerve on our course through the world, to behave in ways that are creative, unpredictable, unforeseeable. Here, Lucretius isn\u0026rsquo;t claiming that the clinamen is the source of free will. Instead, he seems to be using the idea of a swerve more metaphorically: just as atoms swerve from their fixed courses in unpredictable ways, we too swerve from our seemingly fixed courses, not on account of the atomic swerve, but on account of the “whims of each.” We are unpredictable beings in an unpredictable universe.\nHowever, even though Lucretius doesn\u0026rsquo;t go so far as to claim that free will is conjured into existence by the atomic swerving of atoms, he does argue that the existence of genuine indeterminacy makes this a universe in which free will is possible—because it means ultimately that the universe is not fully determined. Lucretius says that the fact that,\n\u0026hellip;the mind Is not bowed by necessity in everything it does And forced to just endure it and to suffer is because Of the slight swerve of the atoms, at a random time and place. [291-294]\nHere, Lucretius looks like he is simply being a good Epicurean, and pointing out that in a fully deterministic universe, there is no space for genuine free will. However, in his Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus takes pains to argue against both necessity and chance as ways of accounting for human agency. A universe governed entirely by necessity would leave no room for genuine choice. But neither would a universe governed entirely by chance. For Epicurus, true agency presents us with a third possibility, which is neither rooted fully in necessity nor in chance. Writing of the prudent person, Epicurus says, “some things happen of necessity, others by chance, and others by our own agency.” For Epicurus, necessity “is not answerable to anyone.” The idea that we are fully determined cannot provide a foundation for any genuine idea of human agency. But neither can chance provide such a foundation because “chance is unstable.”\nTrue agency neither fully belongs to chance nor to necessity. And it is this agency that makes us genuinely autonomous. So for both Epicurus and Lucretius, whatever may be going on at the level of atoms—the cocktail of necessary and chance events—if we want to think properly about human agency, we need to scale things up. Agency happens at the level of human beings, who exist in a universe that is neither fully determined, nor fully ruled by chance. And this agency which makes us genuinely autonomous and morally culpable can ultimately be no more be reduced down to chance than it can to necessity.\nLiving Between Chance and Necessity Where does this leave us? It leaves us in a universe that is caught somewhere between chance and necessity, but that is reducible to neither one nor the other. And in this space in between the two, we find a world is a riot of vigorous, proliferating creativity. No wonder Lucretius begins his poem with the image of the goddess Venus: the overseer of fertility, of fruiting and budding, of new life, of the world\u0026rsquo;s rich abundance. It is a vision of an inherently creative world, throwing up novelty all the time as things grow, develop, bear fruit and pass away, a ferment of creativity in which the “universe’s rich variety” (829) arises out of the simplest of principles.\nBut if this is the world we live in, what are we to do about it? Like many ancient philosophers, Lucretius was preoccupied not just with saying how the world is or how it seems to be, but with exploring how we might live in the light of this. So this will be the subject of the next piece, when we look at Lucretius\u0026rsquo;s On the Nature of the Universe as a guide to life.\nNotes All the quotes from Lucretius come from Alicia Stallings\u0026rsquo; translation, Lucretius: The Nature of Things (Penguin 2007).

            "content": "Two Men, Fighting You don\u0026rsquo;t notice it at first.\nThe two men are fighting it out with big sticks. One has blood streaming down his face. He lifts his arm to bring his cudgel down hard on his opponent\u0026rsquo;s head. The other man lifts his arm to protect himself, while reaching back to swing his own club from the side.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know why they are fighting, or over what. Maybe they are battling for something important. Or perhaps it is a fight started on account of the most trivial slight. There\u0026rsquo;s no way of telling. But whatever the reason for the fight, there is no heroism here, nothing glorious or uplifting. There is only the dull thud when the sticks meet with bodies, underneath a sky that looks as if it is caught between sunshine and storm.\nIt is only when you look more closely that you see it: the two men are knee-deep in mud. They are sinking, as if into quicksand.\nForgetting the World The painting is Men Fighting With Cudgels, by the great Spanish painter Francisco Goya. At the beginning of his book, The Natural Contract, the French philosopher Michel Serres writes about how Goya\u0026rsquo;s painting provides us with an image of our forgetfulness of the world. We are obsessed by the struggle, the battle between antagonists; we are blind to the place where the struggle plays out.\nSerres imagines a group of spectators gambling on the unfolding battle. The bettors put money on one or the other combatant winning—because in a contest like this, somebody must win and somebody must lose. But the antagonists, the bettors and we ourselves don\u0026rsquo;t notice the quicksand. We don\u0026rsquo;t realise—until it is too late—that nobody is going to win this fight. The duellists sink into the mud. Nobody wins and everyone loses, including the gamblers, who have staked their fortunes on a winner.\nIt is an image of philosophy gone wrong. An image of life gone wrong. Aren\u0026rsquo;t we, Serres asks,\nforgetting the world of things themselves, the sand, the water, the mud, the reeds of the marsh? In what quick­ sands are we, active adversaries and sick voyeurs, floundering side by side? And I who write this, in the solitary peace of dawn? [1]\nThe Natural Contract is a book about our obsession with the social contracts that we make and remake, our obsession with interpersonal relationships at the expense of all the other relationships in which we are enmeshed. And it is about the natural contracts that bind us, even if we don\u0026rsquo;t pay attention to them. It is about how the quicksand threatens to engulf us as we squabble for supremacy.\nWhen we forget the world, when we forget the contract that binds us with the world, we risk our own destruction. Obsessed as we are by who is right and who is wrong, the world we share is reduced to ruin. As Michel Foucault (who once shared an office with Serres) once wrote, “the last man, when radiation has finally reduced his last enemy to ashes, will sit down behind some rickety table and begin the trial of the individual responsible.” [2]\nOn the one hand, Serres\u0026rsquo;s reading of Goya\u0026rsquo;s painting is about the environmental crisis that faces us all. But on the other hand, it is also about philosophy. It is about how philosophy, more often than not, is another aspect of this combat, this struggle. And it is about how, in our fascination with winners and losers, we become inattentive to everything else: the clouds, the sky, the distant mountains, and the sucking of the quicksand.\nPhilosophy as Combat As Sarah Mattice points out in her book Metaphor and Metaphilosophy, we often think of philosophy in terms of combat. Mattice quotes Charles Dickens: “Philosophers are only men in armour after all.”\nPhilosophers talk about attacking bad arguments, about fortifying their weak points, so they can become invulnerable, about mounting robust defences of their positions. The whole idea of debate is antagonistic. But being antagonistic. It is about the social contract, the question of who wins and who loses. It may be less muddy and sweaty than the struggle in which Goya\u0026rsquo;s antagonists are involved, but when imagined as a contest, philosophy is still more or less a process of thwacking your opponent with a metaphorical stick until they fall by the wayside.\nThis may not always be a bad thing. Maybe some advances do indeed come about through debate and criticism. But it\u0026rsquo;s probably also true that fewer of them than we imagine come about this way. And as the Zhuangzi puts it, there\u0026rsquo;s no necessary correlation between being successful in debate, and actually being right:\nOnce you and I have started arguing, if you win and I lose, then are you really right and am I really wrong? If I win and you lose, then am I really right and are you really wrong? Is one of us right and the other one wrong? Or are both of us right and both of us wrong? [3]\nAs for Serres, he is a thinker who is famously wary of debate. In an interview with Bruno Latour, he said that “neither debate nor criticism makes any advances, except on the social chessboard and in the conquest of power.” [4] So he, like Sarah Mattice, holds out for the possibility of doing philosophy differently.\nBut if we do want to do philosophy differently, what are the options? Mattice suggests at least two: philosophy as play, and philosophy as aesthetic experience.\nPhilosophy as Play So in what way could you see philosophy as a kind of play? The boundaries between play and combat can sometimes be hard to define precisely: play can be more or less combative; combat can perhaps be more or less playful. But there is substantial a difference in feel between the earnest lumpen combat of Goya\u0026rsquo;s men with sticks, and the idea of play. Whatever Goya\u0026rsquo;s antagonists are doing, they are not playing.\nFor Mattice, one thing that is central to play is that you play not just against others, but also with them. You are playmates, responsive to each other, and to the unfolding game in which you are engaged. And there\u0026rsquo;s nothing about this ongoing responsiveness that is inherently combative. Even if you do slip into combativeness (as I do when I play Scrabble), the fact that this is play puts limits on the extent of this combativeness, and on the nakedness of our hunger for victory at all costs.\nChildren playing in a Chinese garden. 18th—19th century. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not the winning, we were told as children, it\u0026rsquo;s the taking part. Even if we feel resentful when we hear this, we also know that it is always at least half true. Sometimes the winning matters. But in a game, winning doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter at any cost: not to the extent that the desire to win risks breaking the game itself. And there are other reasons that we play, apart from simply winning. We might play for no stakes at all, simply to keep the game going, or to enjoy the to-and-fro between us, or for the delight of play itself.\nThinking about philosophy as play not only brings in new possibilities of delight, but it also allows us to see things that combative metaphors do not. As Ian Bogost points out in his book, Play Anything, play always takes place somewhere: in a playground. Bogost writes that, “A playground is a place where play takes place, and play is a practice of manipulating the things you happen to find in a playground.”[5] This attention to where one is playing changes the dynamic considerably. Think back to Goya\u0026rsquo;s image. Part of the problem is that the antagonists are forgetful of the playground in which they find themselves. What if they took a breath, decided to get more playful? Then the world would come flooding back in, and they might find different ways to play the situation in which they found themselves.\nSo engaging in philosophy as a kind of play allows us to ask different questions about what it means to do philosophy. How can I engage creatively with this philosophy? How can I make use of what I find here? How can I test the boundaries of these ideas? Who can I find to play with? And thinking along these lines allows us to think about building different sets of relationships: with playmates, with the places where we have carved our playgrounds to explore.\nPhilosophy as Aesthetic Experience The third metaphor Mattice proposes for thinking through philosophy is that of philosophy as a kind of aesthetic experience. Philosophy is not always a battle, nor is it always a way of playing. Instead, it can be an engagement with something artful, the way we might contemplate a painting or a novel.\nMattice says that aesthetic experience involves three components. The first is a work of art: whether that is a painting by Matisse or a philosophy book by Mattice. The second is an artist, somebody who creates a work (although this isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily true: we can be aesthetically moved by a landscape, or a goldfinch). And the third component Mattice mentions is a participant, somebody who engages with the artwork. For Mattice, thinking about philosophy as aesthetic experience draws our attention to all kinds of things we might otherwise overlook: the language in which the philosophy expressed, the style of the writing, the way a work of philosophy is embedded in its cultural context, the way it makes us feel.\nWhat would it be like to engage in philosophy as aesthetic experience? It would not be like asking “how can I attack or defend this?” as you would if you treated philosophy as combat. Nor would it be like asking “what can I do with this?”, in the way you might if you treated philosophy as play. Instead, it would be like asking, among other things, “what might this do to me?” It would be a way of entering into a philosophical idea or philosophical work, remaining open to being affected by it, open to being transformed.\nChoosing Our Metaphors Combat, play, or aesthetic experience? Which is the right way to think about philosophy?\nIf you were an advocate of philosophy of combat, you might look at this list of different ways of engaging with philosophy, and try to decide which is the winner. But why this obsession with winners and losers? Why not play with the possibilities? Why not engage in aesthetic contemplation, open to the possibility of being transformed? Or why not move between these different metaphors to see what they reveal? Why not make it up as you go along, moving from metaphor to metaphor, in the knowledge that there\u0026rsquo;s no right way of doing philosophy, but that the different approaches will yield different results?\nNotes This piece is dedicated to my students at Parami University, with whom I\u0026rsquo;ve been exploring all these ideas on our course on the Arts of Argument. And the argument here draws heavily on Sarah Mattice\u0026rsquo;s Metaphor and Metaphilosophy (Lexington Books 2014).

            "content": "The Many Voices of the Huainanzi In the year 139 BCE, Liu An (劉安 179-122 BCE), the scholarly-minded King of Huainan, wanted to ingratiate himself to his cousin once removed, the Emperor Wu of Han. So he did what any self-respecting scholar king would do. Anxious to demonstrate his usefulness and his political nous, he convened a group of scholars to put together a text on the art of leadership to present to the young emperor. The resulting text, the Huainanzi, was an ambitious work: a compilation of everything a self-respecting ruler should know, a manual for running an effective state.\nLiu An was not only the king of Huainan, but also a scholar in his own right who wrote poems, and treatises on topics as diverse as music, alchemy, and philosophy. And the Huainanzi reflects this breadth of interests. It covers a dizzying array of topics: from statecraft to military strategy; from metaphysics to the prediction of good and bad fortune; from the art of rhetoric to the challenges of ruling over an empire that encompasses a broad diversity of peoples and customs.\nIt is this diversity and range that make the Huainanzi so fascinating. It is more an anthology than a single-authored text, a text that not only was composed by many hands, but that contains many voices. Not only are the topics in the text astonishingly wide-ranging, but so are the philosophical sources on which the text draws. The Huainanzi ranges freely between Confucian, Daoist, and Legalist perspectives. It draws the Daodejing and the Zhuangzi, but also on the Book of Changes, the Spring and Autumn Annals, the philosophy of Mozi, the thought of Confucian thinkers including Mengzi and Xunzi, and the legalist thinker Hanfeizi. And all of this is by design. The postface to the text says that:\nWe have not followed a path made by a solitary footprint or adhered to instructions from a single perspective or allowed ourselves to be entrapped or fettered by things so that we would not advance or shift according to the age. [1]\nAs a ruler of a sprawling empire, what is more useful? A single perspective, a single theory of how to rule? Or something that can more closely reflect the chaotic diversity of your empire: a toolkit for handling diverse peoples, cultures, situations, and ideas? Single theories and single perspectives are fatally inflexible: they are not responsive to changing times and changing circumstances. So the Huainanzi presents itself as a set of ways of weaving all this complexity together to create an enduring political fabric.\nWe have created and composed these writings and discourses as a means to knot the net of the Way and its Potency, and weave the web of humankind and its affairs. [2]\nRoot and Branch This might sound as if the Huainanzi is something of a ragbag, a text both incoherent and baggy. But this would be to misrepresent it. There is instead an ambitious attempt to structure all of this material into something that is both coherent and also hospitable to the sheer diversity of its sources. For all its breadth, the Huainanzi is very carefully constructed.\nThe first eight chapters set out the “roots” of an underlying theory that animates the text. These “roots” of ben (本) are: the “way” (dao 道), “potency” (de 德), “heaven” (tian 天), “earth” (di 地), “time” (shi 時), “resonance between things” (ganying 感應), humankind (ren 人) and morality (renyi 仁義). Taken together these roots set out a base-line philosophical stance from which everything in the text follows.\nThe chapters that follow then explore the “branches” (mo 末), the practical application of this base-line philosophical stance, exploring how these underlying principles play out in specific circumstances and how they can be applied to the bewildering diversity of human affairs (shi 事).\nFor the Huainanzi, to ignore underlying principles and think only about individual circumstances is to cut yourself off from understanding the deeper trends in how things unfold. But to ignore individual circumstances and think only in terms of underlying principles is to become blind to the changing conditions in which we all live. You need both: theory and practice, underlying principles and the way these principles structure uniquely unfolding sets of conditions.\nThus, numerous are the words we have composed and extensive are the illustrations we have provided, yet we still fear that people will depart from the root and follow the branches. Thus, if we speak of the Way but do not speak of affairs, there would be no means to shift with the times [Conversely,] if we speak of affairs but do not speak of the Way, there would be no means to move with [the processes of] transformation. [3]\nOf Clods and Chariots The first of the branch chapters asks about techniques (shu 術) that are useful to a ruler. In line with its Daoist roots, it proposes that the best way of ruling is not by action, but instead by non-action (wuwei 無為), or by optimally minimising action. The ruler\u0026rsquo;s task is not to be constantly making decisions. Instead, it is to establish the conditions – both internal and external – where the intervention required is at a minimum. Put in place just, fair and impartial laws and policies that “accord with the human heart”, cultivate yourself to the greatest degree possible, and the state will more or less govern itself.\nThe text even suggests that the very best kind ruler should be cloddish (the term in Chinese is kuairan 塊然): self-contained, inactive and unmoved.\nThe ruler’s techniques [consist of] establishing non-active management and carrying out wordless instructions. Quiet and tranquil, he does not move; by [even] one degree he does not waver; adaptive and compliant, he relies on his underlings; dutiful and accomplished, he does not labor. [4]\nThis is not about absolute non-action. It is about the ability to maintain an inner tranquillity and unmovingness even while in the thick of the onrush of external events.\nThe effective ruler, the text says, is like the famous charioteer Zaofu who “smooths the ride by controlling the reins and bit and regulates the speed by harmonising with the horse\u0026rsquo;s lips and breathing.” Just like a skilled charioteer, a paragon ruler will expend only the leastmost energy, drawing on inner reserves of stillness while remaining responsive to the changing terrain, the galloping of the horses and the direction of travel. [5]\nResonance and Sensitivity The images of the clod and of the charioteer may seem at odds. But to make sense of the Huainanzi\u0026rsquo;s position, it might help to explore one of the text\u0026rsquo;s more puzzling concepts. And that is the idea of resonance or ganying.\nThe idea of ganying or resonance is that human beings exist in a sympathetic relationship with the rest of the universe. We are quiveringly sensitive creatures, our senses, our bodies, our emotions, and our thoughts attuned to changes in our environment. Just as, when you pluck a string on a musical instrument, another string attuned to the same note thrums in response, we thrum and hum in mutual harmony with the other things of the world. We are sensitive, quivering creatures, fully immersed in a sensitive, quivering world. The philosophers of the Huainanzi also propose that the universe, or at least the social world, is similarly responsive to us: by means of just rule, a good ruler can stir the hearts of the people to sincerity (if this seems implausible, remember how we often accept the reverse unthinkingly: the notion that unjust or corrupt rule is more broadly corrupting of a culture as a whole). This stirring of sincerity through resonance is what the text means when it says that the cloddish leader rules by means of “wordless instructions.”\nHowever, the idea of resonance takes the text into a strange territory. And the Huainanzi is fully aware of this strangeness. The chapter that explores this resonance is called Lan Ming (覽冥), which translates as “Surveying Obscurities.” And as an example of this obscure resonance, the Huainanzi returns to charioteers. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty impressive, the text says, to have a charioteer like Zaofu who is so much in control that they control the reins and the bit. But how much more impressive were the mythical charioteers Qian Qie and Da Bing, who:\nconsidered reins and bits superfluous, got rid of whips and cast aside goads. Before the chariot began to move, it was starting on its own. Before the horses were given the signal, they were walking on their own. They paced [like the] sun and moved [like the] moon. They flashed [like the] stars and advanced [like the] dark. They raced [like] lightning and leaped [like] ghosts. [6]\nOn Chariots and Bicycles, or, How to Avoid Tragedy Is this any more than wishful thinking, or bad metaphysics? Or is there something in this exemplary charioteering of Qian Qie and Da Bing that is practically useful? Here, it might be worth thinking a bit harder about efficacy and skill.\nImagine, for example, that you are a novice charioteer, driving your chariot at speed. Things are going well, but then something changes, and you suddenly feel things slipping out of your control. (If this example is too unfamiliar, and you don\u0026rsquo;t spend your spare time perfecting your charioteering, imagine instead that you are on a bike that is beginning to career out of control.)\nSo, what happens when you experience this loss of control? The first thing is that you experience panic and alarm. The next thing is that you desperately try to reassert control. You tug on the reins, yank on the handlebars, squeeze the brakes a little too hard… And, of course, this is precisely how tragedy happens. As you clench up and attempt to reassert control, you lose your sense of responsiveness to the situation you are in, and things start to spiral even further out of control. The chariot begins to tip over, the wheels of the bike start to skid on the gravel…\nThis experience is (if you are like me, at least) surprisingly common, in all domains of life and not just charioteering and riding bicycles. And it is the very definition of tragedy: we see our imagined fate heading towards us, so we assert our control in an attempt to forestall it. And in ratcheting up our control, we also hasten the onrush of the very fate we wanted to avoid.\nThe perspective of the Huainanzi suggests that we would do better to move in a different direction: not towards greater intervention, but instead in the direction of Qian Qie and Da Bing, loosening our grip and relaxing into a broader awareness of the unfolding situation. Non-action, resonance, sensitivity. In this way, we might find that the momentary danger passes, and that we are once again, through processes that feel obscure and even almost magical, driving our chariot with consummate skill.\nHowever, as a way of avoiding tragedy, nothing is foolproof. For all his learning, Liu An himself got it badly wrong. Driving his chariot too hard, he started to harbour ambitions to the imperial throne. An imperial commission investigated his supposed crimes. One of the most damning pieces of evidence they turned up was that Liu had ordered an imperial seal to be carved for his own use.\nThe philosopher king was found guilty, and in the year 122 BCE, as the palace soldiers came to arrest him, Liu An committed suicide.\nNotes [1] John Major, Sarah A.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Texts and Woven Threads The tradition of Nyāya philosophy in India goes back to a text called the Nyāya-sūtra. It is one of the most extensive treatments of the art of reasoning to be found in early Indian philosophy.\nThe Nyāya-sūtra is a fascinating text, one that explores the relationship between knowing, practical action, and doubt. The various strands in the sūtra (the word “sūtra\u0026quot; सूत्र means “thread”) were probably brought together into something resembling the current form around 150 in the Common Era. However, the text almost certainly contains debates, discussions, and ideas that long predate this.\nThe text as it has come down to us bears the hallmarks of a text that was made to be recited, a part of the oral tradition. It is constructed out of tightly crafted aphorisms that lend it to memorisation and oral transmission.\nAs for the authorship of the Nyāya-sūtra, it is attributed to a man called Akṣapāda Gautama. If the author existed at all, we don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about him. Various accounts put his dates around anything from the 6th century BCE to the second century CE when the text reached its current form. The name Akṣapāda means “gazing at the feet.” One colourful suggestion is that this is a reference to how Akṣapāda Gautama spent his days lost in thought, staring at the ground. But there\u0026rsquo;s no reason to think this is true.\nThere are many puzzles around the Nyāya-sūtra – how it evolved, when it evolved, who its many authors were, how we can date it. Here, as with so many things, any claims to certain knowledge are unreliable. And it is perhaps appropriate that this is the case. Because these kinds of questions – about what we know, what we think we know, and how reliable our knowledge is – lie at the heart of the Nyāya-sūtra and Nyāya philosophy more broadly_._\nKnowing and Acting The question that the Nyāya-sūtra asks is this: how can we know? The word “nyāya” can be translated as something like “right reasoning.” And the Nyāya-sūtra starts by arguing that the sources of knowledge, or pramāṇas, matter precisely because they are practically useful. __ Here is the gloss provided by the 5th-century commentator, Vātsyāyana.\nWhen an object is comprehended thro­ugh a knowledge source (pramāṇa), it becomes possible to engage in successful goal­-directed activity. Thus, a knowledge source is useful (arthavat). Without a knowledge source, there would be no effective cognition of an object. Without such cognition, there would be no successful action. [1]\nThis concern with knowledge is no idle philosophical speculation. Instead, knowledge matters because if we start from the point of view of knowledge that is unsecured, or just plain wrong, we will end up setting our sights on the wrong kind of goals, or failing to reach the goals we aspire to. Knowledge underpins action. And so if our approach to knowledge is messed up, then our actions will fail to be effective.\nFor the Nyāya philosophers, knowledge is a process. In the Nyāya system, knowledge isn\u0026rsquo;t a store of information on which we can draw. We don\u0026rsquo;t possess knowledge the way a squirrel might possess a hoard of nuts. Instead, knowledge involves repeatedly coming-to-know. It is a dynamic process, one that allows us to attain our goals, whether these are worldly (accumulating wealth and power, for example), or more ambitious (liberation from rebirth).\nSquirrel. Late 1800s. Boston Public Library, public domain, via Wikimedia Commons.\nReliable Knowing This being the case, the Nyāya philosophers are preoccupied with the question of the reliability of this process of coming-to-know. In this sense, knowledge is like a vehicle: it gets us places. And a vehicle that is broken, or that is unreliable, or that works badly is going to get us precisely nowhere.\nIn its exploration of what it means to know reliably, the Nyāya-sūtra proposes four sources of knowledge (pramāṇas). These are perception (pratyakṣa), inference (anumāna), analogy (upamāna) and testimony (śabda). We come to know things, in other words, by perceiving them, by drawing inferences from other things, by making analogies, and by relying on the testimonies of others.\nPerception is the basis of the whole system. For the Nyāya philosophers, perception is the meeting of a sense faculty (for example, the sense faculty of seeing) and an object (for example, a squirrel). Inference depends upon perception: if we are to draw inferences, first we have to perceive things. We perceive swollen clouds, and we infer that it will rain (this is inference “from something prior” because the swollen clouds precede the rain). We perceive a swollen river and infer that it has been raining upstream (this is inference “from something later”). Analogy is about shared properties (“a buffalo is like a cow” is the example given in the text). It is a way of knowing through similarity with something familiar (and so is also anchored in perception). And finally, testimony is the word or instruction of a trustworthy authority for whom knowledge, presumably, also begins in perception.\nOf course, not all perceptions, inferences, analogies, and testimonies are reliable sources of knowledge. But having divided up potentially reliable sources of knowledge into these four categories, the Nyāya philosophers can then explore in more detail questions about how these four processes work – or how they break down.\nSunstroke and Philosophy Here\u0026rsquo;s an example of one such breakdown in ways of knowing. A couple of years ago, while on the Bulgarian coast, I had heatstroke. I was walking back to my hotel with friends, and suddenly my everyday experience of the world started to glitch. It was really weird. When I turned my head, the world fragmented. My vision was all over the place. Everything was like a Cubist painting.\nLe Livre by Juan Gris (1911). Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nOn that day in Bulgaria, I went back to my hotel room, lay down, cooled off, and drank water. In about an hour or so, I had recovered. But the sheer weirdness of this breakdown in perception stayed with me.\nIt was pretty dramatic, but we all have less dramatic experiences than this every day. For example, one day you are in the park, and you see a squirrel scampering around under the tree. You think you are seeing everything about it: its fur, its plump body, its little beady eye, its tail. But when you get a couple of steps closer, you realise it isn\u0026rsquo;t a squirrel at all: it is a tin can.\nSo perception is not reliable. Or not always. Nor are inferences. We can draw successful and unsuccessful inferences. As for analogies, sometimes analogies help us, but every so often (more often than we might like) they lead us astray. And we all know that testimony can be flawed and that this too can fail us.\nWhen to Doubt, and When Not To This raises the question of when we should doubt these processes of coming-to-know, and when we should just go along with things. Going around the whole time doubting our perceptions, our inferences, our tendencies to draw analogies, and the testimony of others is both exhausting and counter-productive. It takes time and effort. And it gets in the way of getting anything useful done. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on testimony, you\u0026rsquo;d never step on a plane. If you didn\u0026rsquo;t rely on your perceptions, you would be able to move around the world. If you couldn\u0026rsquo;t draw inferences, you couldn\u0026rsquo;t think very much at all. And human thinking is irredeemably analogical and metaphorical, so we can\u0026rsquo;t do without analogy either.\nSo when should you doubt these sources of knowing, and when should you just go along with things? The Nyāya answer is refreshingly straightforward: you should doubt when you have a legitimate reason to do so. When the world glitches due to heatstroke, for example. You should doubt when you stumble across something that gives you pause, and makes you question the sources of your knowing.\nWe simply can\u0026rsquo;t go round making sure we\u0026rsquo;re absolutely certain about everything all the time. If there is good reason to trust the processes of coming-to-know, there\u0026rsquo;s no point in doubting. But when there is a glitch, a gap, a tension, a contradiction, a puzzle, this is when doubt comes into play. It is the point at which you say, “Hold on. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t look right…” Then you go seeking more details about what exactly isn\u0026rsquo;t right, or what exactly isn\u0026rsquo;t clear. Doubt comes in at the point at which something prompts further investigation. Doubt, the Nyāya-sūtra says, is “deliberative awareness in need of details about something particular.” [2]\nGetting Things Done With Nyāya Philosophy Like many early Indian traditions, the ultimate goal of Nyāya philosophy is liberation. But even if we have our sights set on less lofty goals, the Nyāya approach to knowing is a useful one. When things don\u0026rsquo;t look quite right, when you feel some sense of legitimate doubt creeping in, when the world begins to glitch and you suspect sunstroke, these are useful questions to ask:\nWhat are my perceptions, and how reliable are they? What inferences am I drawing, and how reliable are they? What analogies am I making, and are they helpful? To what extent am I relying on the testimony of others, and how reliable is this testimony? Even if your ultimate goal is not liberation from the endless rounds of rebirth (which was the goal of the Nyāya philosophers), these questions can help us navigate through the world. Because if we care about the practical ends of human life, we can\u0026rsquo;t avoid asking about the reliability of perception, inference, analogy, and testimony.\nNotes [1] Nyāya-sūtra: Selections with early commentaries, translated by Matthew Dasti and Stephen Phillips (Hackett 2017), p. 14\n[2] ibid. p. 41\nFurther Reading Books and articles Matthew Dasti and Stephen Phillips\u0026rsquo; translation published by Hackett (2017) is excellent and clear.\nFor an accessible (but much more in-depth) exploration of Nyāya philosophy, try Peter Adamson and Jonardon Ganeri\u0026rsquo;s Classical Indian Philosophy (Oxford University Press 2020).\n",

            "content": "Loneliness, Mortality and Terror Okay, folks! Strap in for an extended philosopher file, where we\u0026rsquo;re talking about fundamental problems in philosophy, why there may be no such things, what it might mean to approach philosophy more like an anthropologist, and how to redraw our maps of human life.\nSeveral years ago, I attended an academic conference on philosophy. Some way through the conference, mid-afternoon, at the point when everybody was becoming a bit somnolent, I found myself in a half-empty university teaching room, my notebook in front of me. In front of the room stood a tall, Norwegian philosopher. He had an air of philosophical gravity, and he spoke with a slow, careful precision. \u0026ldquo;I am going to talk about the fundamental conditions of human existence,\u0026rdquo; he said. I turned the page on my notebook, understanding that matters of such importance deserved a new, fresh page.\nThe philosopher started to list these fundamental conditions, of which there were three in total. “Existential loneliness,” he said. He paused. I wrote those two words down in my notebook, in capitals, underlining them twice, for good effect. The philosopher continued. “Impending mortality,” he said. Again, I wrote it down, nodding to myself seriously. “And…”, the philosopher added, leaving the best until last, “exposure to the terror of existence.” This, too, I wrote down.\nAs the talk continued, the philosopher carefully expounded on these three fundamental conditions of human existence. And the more he talked, the more restless I became. I found myself wondering: Were these really the fundamental conditions of human existence? And if they were, who said so? On what grounds?\nThe talk came to a close. After the talk was the afternoon break, and I was desperate to get out into the sunshine for a few moments. But before then, the Norwegian philosopher was taking questions, and I found myself with a burning question that I wanted to ask. So I put up my hand.\nI\u0026rsquo;m never good in these circumstances. I\u0026rsquo;m not assertive enough. I am awkward and lack confidence. So several other people got there before me, asking the philosopher to say more about terror, loneliness and mortality. The philosopher was most obliging in this respect. And then, just as I thought I had a chance to ask this burning question, then the chair called the session to a close, and we all dispersed.\nIn the break, I went to track down the Norwegian philosopher, but he had already disappeared. And I never got a chance to ask the question. As a result, it has stayed with me. As a question, it feels awkward, even somewhat naïve. But it has continued to haunt me. The question is this: are loneliness, mortality and terror really the fundamental conditions of human existence? Or are they only the fundamental conditions of (a certain kind of) Norwegian existence?\nDeath in the Sickroom, by Edvard Munch, 1893. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nConnectedness, Vitality and Delight I have no doubt that the Norwegian philosopher was personally preoccupied by these questions. It seemed to me that these questions were not just woven deeply throughout his talk, but also throughout his life: they mattered to him, not just as a philosopher but also as a human being. They were part of the warp and weft of his being.\nNot only this, but these preoccupations seemed to be ones that the philosopher shared with at least a sizeable chunk of the audience. During the question and answer session, the other philosophers in the room asked lots of deep questions about loneliness, mortality and terror, but they seemed to take for granted the claim that these things were fundamental to human life.\nWhat I was less convinced by was the claim that these questions were somehow fundamental. It\u0026rsquo;s no doubt true that loneliness is a part of most lives. But so too is connectedness. Is existential loneliness any deeper than existential connectedness? It\u0026rsquo;s not certain that it is. Similarly, death is something we all face (even if, as the Epicureans pointed out, we don\u0026rsquo;t experience our own death). But living is something we\u0026rsquo;re all involved in as well. It\u0026rsquo;s pretty much a full-time job. So is our mortality any more fundamental than our ongoing vitality? And as for the terror of existence, there are many terrors in the world. But there are many things of wonder and delight. So what about our experience of these wonders, these delights? Aren\u0026rsquo;t these a part of the story as well? And who is to say that they are less fundamental than terror?\nOn What is Fundamental Here, the temptation might be to take one of two approaches. One is to double-down and defend the claims that these things are fundamental. The other is to strike through the words \u0026ldquo;loneliness,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;morality\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;terror,\u0026rdquo; and replace them with the words, \u0026ldquo;connectedness,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;vitality\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;delight.\u0026rdquo; Then we could set about promoting this new list as a list of what is truly fundamental.\nBut does this get us very far? Or does the problem go deeper than this? Perhaps the problem is in the idea that we can identify certain preoccupations or perspectives or ideas as fundamental, or more fundamental than all others. It is an undeniably common move among philosophers: the tendency to take what are legitimate preoccupations, and to give these preoccupations more weight by claiming that they are somehow fundamental preoccupations. But this move also makes conversations about what is interesting in life somewhat difficult. If you turn up somewhere with your own bundle of preoccupations, and with the conviction that these preoccupations are somehow fundamental, and somebody else rocks up with their own preoccupations, claiming they are equally fundamental, the conversation is going to be hard-going. They will tell you that you can\u0026rsquo;t talk about your preoccupations until you address their preoccupations. Meanwhile, you will argue precisely the opposite. And if you are equally matched in stubbornness, you will end up having a fruitless and ultimately boring discussion which will get you precisely nowhere.\nThere are, however, better ways of dealing with this. One is to treat what is going on in the way that an anthropologist might (and hope that the other person is going to extend you the same courtesy). In other words, you can think, \u0026ldquo;Oh, look, here\u0026rsquo;s a strange and uniquely quirky human being (as we are all strange and uniquely quirky human beings),\u0026rdquo; and you can resolve to hang out with them a bit more, try and get along with them, and try and find out how their world works or how it looks. This involves taking both your own preoccupations, and the other person\u0026rsquo;s, as legitimate and interesting, but being sceptical about how fundamental they really are (even if they feel like they are). And this is a way to having more fun and interesting conversations.\nOf course, this isn\u0026rsquo;t always possible. The other person may not play along, leaving you with only one choice: between a conversation both boring and fruitless, on the one hand, and no conversation at all. In such circumstances, it is not unreasonable to shrug your shoulders, politely take your leave, and go and talk to somebody else.\nOn Failing to Worry About God and Death This tendency to think that or own preoccupations are fundamental, and other people\u0026rsquo;s preoccupations are less so, is one of the reasons that it can be both unsettling and enriching to find yourself exposed to unfamiliar philosophical traditions. Because apparently fundamental questions are always fundamental questions within a particular cultural and historical framework. And when that framework shifts, so do the questions.\nTake God, for example. In what is called, for want of a better term, Western philosophy, the question of how we demonstrate the existence of God is big news. Pick up any introduction to Western philosophy, and there\u0026rsquo;s likely to be at least one chapter (even if it is inserted only apologetically, towards the end) about God. And for many philosophers down the ages, questions about God have certainly been included among the list of fundamental questions that philosophy should and must tackle. But these questions are really not particularly big news at all in the philosophical traditions of Confucianism. When Confucius was asked about gods and spirits, he typically deflected the conversation. Why ask about gods and spirits, he would say, if you are not even capable of managing your relationships with your fellow human beings? This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that Confucius was some kind of atheist, because to be an atheist, you need a well-formed notion of god to refute: and this is precisely what Confucius (and his cultural setting) lacked, something he had no interest in. Questions about either demonstrating or disproving the existence of gods and spirits (let alone trying to work out their attributes) not only never interested Confucius, but perhaps never entered his mind as interesting philosophical questions.\nIn this same passage where Confucius shrugs off talk about gods and spirits, he also takes a similarly cavalier approach to another apparently big philosophical issue: the issue of death. When asked about death, Confucius replied, “You don\u0026rsquo;t yet know life; so how can you know about death?” And he left it at that. This is a part of a more overarching insouciance in the face of death. According to the Analects, the Duke of Shu once asked Confucius’s disciple Zilu to describe his teacher. Zilu was at a loss for words. “But why didn’t you just say this,” Confucius asked. “That I am simply a person—one so full of passion he forgets to eat, one so joyful that he forgets his worries, one who does not think about old age as it approaches?”\nHere, there is no tremor of existential terror in the face of mortality. The ideal way of facing death, it seems, is with a shrugging unconcern. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that Confucius is a philosopher who ignores death. Instead, he thinks that the really interesting question isn\u0026rsquo;t how we get to grips with the horror of our morality (there is no sign of this horror in Confucius), but instead how we deal with the deaths of others, and what it means to care for the dead. When asked about the dead, Confucius said, “Should a friend die, with nobody to care for them, I would bury them.”\nIf death does present a big philosophical issue for Confucius (and for later Confucians like Xunzi), the big issue is how we should care for the dead and dying, and how we should mourn, so that we can better care for the living. When his dear friend Yan Hui died, Confucius mourned so bitterly his disciples reprimand him. But Confucius replied, “If I am not to mourn for this man, then for whom?”\nSo it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be quite accurate to say that death is a complete non-problem for Confucius. But if death does present us with problems, these are not the same kind of problems as those that preoccupy Norwegian philosophers.\nConstellations of Thought Dunhuang Star Map, British Library. Tang Dynasty. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nIt is, of course, possible to say that Confucius was misguided. We could claim that he didn\u0026rsquo;t recognise the importance of questions about God, or about death (or about other big issues, like Free Will\u0026hellip; but we\u0026rsquo;ve not got space to open that can of worms!), and that this was a philosophical error. We could say that in comprehensively failing to recognise these kinds of questions as fundamental, Confucius was simply a bad philosopher. But it\u0026rsquo;s not clear that this teaches us anything new about Confucius\u0026rsquo;s preoccupations, or about our own preoccupations, or about human life in general. Conversely, we could dig in and claim that Confucius\u0026rsquo;s concerns are the real, true fundamental concerns, and that everybody else (from Saint Augustine to Norwegian philosophers) is wrong or misguided. But again, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t get us very far.\nInstead, it is more useful to go back to that more anthropological approach, and to think in terms of constellations of thought, each of which cluster around specific sets of concerns and preoccupations. These concerns and preoccupations may be (as is the way with constellations) contingent and to some extent arbitrary: they are the result of particular histories and particular sets of conditions. But they are no less compelling for all that.\nThis is one reason that it is worth reading across and between philosophical traditions. Because the more you read across different philosophical traditions, the more it becomes apparent that in these traditions, the maps of preoccupations are very different from each other. What is a problem in one place is often a non-problem somewhere else. And vice versa.\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that there aren\u0026rsquo;t many points of connection: there are issues and tensions that recur throughout our lives, simply by virtue of being human: pre-philosophical facts we can\u0026rsquo;t get round. It\u0026rsquo;s a fact that we all die. It\u0026rsquo;s a fact that we need to eat and find shelter to survive. It\u0026rsquo;s a fact that we are social animals. But the meanings we give to death, or our need for nourishment and shelter, or our social existence, are not the same across contexts. There is no one map for human life. And thinking there should be a single map, or a set of fundamental truths, is going to cramp our style and diminish our creativity.\nThis, finally, is one reason why here at Looking for Wisdom, we care about exploring a rich diversity of philosophical traditions. Because in doing so, we can free ourselves from asking the same questions we have always asked, and we can find ways to start creatively drawing new maps of human life.\n",

            "content": "Chronicles and Caterpillars If there\u0026rsquo;s anything that we can predict with certainty about the course of history, it is that history is unpredictable. This is an insight that was central to the thought of the Chinese philosopher Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒).\nDong was born some time around 198 BCE in Guangchuan, now in present-day Hebei. What we know about his life comes from a couple of sources. First, a few scrappy references in the Shiji (史記) or Records of the Grand Historian, by the historian Sima Qian (司馬遷). And second, the longer account of his life in the Han Shu (漢書) by the scholar Ban Gu (班固).\nDong Zhongshu was a thinker with broad intellectual interests, and a determinedly synthesising sensibility. He drew together Confucianism, yin and yang theory, an interest in politics, and an abiding concern with history. And when it came to history, what fascinated him most was the sheer oddness of how history unfolds, the unpredictable, uncertain nature of events.\nFrom an early age, Dong was fascinated by the Chunqiu (春秋), or Spring and Autumn Annals, a chronicle of the state of Lu. The Chunqiu sets out, with incredible compression, the history of Lu from the year 722 BCE to the year 481 BCE. It is made up of the briefest of annotations, on average, no more than ten characters long. For example, here is the section recording a series of events in 688 BCE.\nIn summer, in the sixth month, Shuo, the Prince of Wei, entered Wei. In autumn, our lord arrived from the attack on Wei. There was an infestation of caterpillars. [1]\nThis is typical for the Chunqiu: brief notes about who is attacking whom, what the harvest is doing, and unexpected events.\nThis laconic chronicle was the basis for a number of more extended commentaries, the most famous of which is the Zuozhuan, the largest extant text from pre-imperial China.\nThe first page of the Zuozhuan, in a 16th century edition. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nDong Zhongshu was deeply familiar with the Chunqiu and its commentaries, and his scholarship was widely admired. His reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as an academician. And he was almost the archetypical bookworm: Sima Qian tells us that for a period of three years, he was so wrapped up in his work that nobody ever even saw him venture out into the garden.\nWhen the emperor Wudi came to the throne, Dong was appointed Chancellor of the kingdom of Jiangdu. According to Ban Gu, Dong was a successful advisor who “never failed to get the results for which he hoped.” [2] But things soon turned sour in the palace. Dong Zhongshu was dismissed from his post – it is not clear why – and demoted to Palace Counsellor.\nAfter his demotion, he doubled down on his study of unexpected and anomalous events. This enthusiasm for anomalies was almost his undoing. During his time as Palace Counsellor, fires broke out in a shrine dedicated to Gaozu, the founder of the Han dynasty. Dong Zhongshu, being the scholar he was, jotted down notes on these unexpected happenings. Shortly afterwards, his rival Zhufu Yan (主父偃) found the notes and took them to Wudi. The emperor consulted a number of scholars and officials, and Dong Zhongshu fell under suspicion of disloyalty. These were, after all, deeply inauspicious events – so what was Dong Zhongshu doing scribbling secretive little notes about them? He was sentenced to death by a committee of scholar-officials, only to be reprieved by the emperor.\nUnsurprisingly, this put Dong off both politics and his enthusiasm for writing about the strange and unexpected. After his fall from grace, he was offered a position as advisor to Liu Duan, the king of Jiaoxi and the elder brother of emperor Wudi. Liu was known for his dissolute ways of life, and his fondness for arbitrarily executing his officials. Dong feigned illness and refused the post. He spent the rest of his days at home, occasionally taking visitors from the court seeking his advice, but keeping the world of politics at arm\u0026rsquo;s length. He died in old age, some time around the year 107 BCE. [3]\nThe Call of the Weird Dong\u0026rsquo;s abiding obsession with the role that anomalous, chance and unexpected events played in human life owed a lot to the Chunqiu. The Spring and Autumn Annals paid particular attention to omens, portents, and anomalies. Here, for example, is a section recording events in 644 BCE, where there are some inauspicious omens sighted in the skies above the city.\nIn the sixteenth year, in spring, in the royal first month, on the wushen day, the first day of the month, stones fell from the sky in Song, five in number. This same month, six fishhawks flew backward across the Song capital. [4]\nPainting of a hawk by Lin Liang Ming Dynasty (mid 15th century). Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nDong was fascinated by these accounts. What could we take from anomalous events? How could we understand them? Things like hawks flying backwards (no doubt due to high winds) are only more obvious examples of the more general truth that history is made up of one unexpected event after another. And part of the fascination of the Chunqiu for Dong Zhongshu was the way it made clear the sheer oddness of history, the way that another natural disaster or unanticipated happening always lurks just around the corner.\nFor Dong Zhongshu, this meant that one of the crucial arts of government was seeking to understand, as best one could, the deeper patterns underlying apparently anomalous events. Dong\u0026rsquo;s hunch was this: if we can embrace and understand this weirdness and unpredictability, then we might have some chance of offsetting its harms, and taking advantage of the changeability of things.\nThe Disorder of the World Dong also took from the Zuozhuan the idea that disasters and anomalies were signs that the world was fundamentally disordered. But the Zuozhuan also suggested that the ultimate source of this disorder was a social. Dong took seriously the claim made in the Zuozhuan that events like fishhawks flying backward (because of high winds) and stones falling from the sky, were,\nmatters of yin and yang and not matters in which one can locate the auspicious or the inauspicious. Auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise from human beings. [5]\nPut otherwise, the world is a chaotic place because of the way that we intervene in the world. Bad government has a habit of throwing things out of sync. And so when anomalies occur, Dong argued, they remind us that the world stands in need of some remedial action. Events such as these can act as a call to begin working on reordering the world, by restoring a more just and judicious system of government. In the Chunqiu fanlu (春秋繁露), or Luxuriant Gems of the Spring and Autumn, attributed to Dong Zhongshu, it says:\nHeaven conveys its warning to decadent polities by way of disasters in the hope that those who manage them will reform their ways and with the intention that those regimes will be saved from destruction thanks to the encouragement of learning and of the right sort of action. [6]\nBad government and black swans This raises the question: what is the right sort of action? Here, Dong drew upon yin-yang theory, but gave this theory a moral slant. He associated yang with virtue (de 德), and with life, “as seen at the height of summer.” Meanwhile, he associated yin with punishment (xing 刑) and with the closure or ending of life, “as seen in the depths of winter.” This led him to argue that effective rule should be rooted not in punishment, but instead in virtuous acts that contributed to the flourishing of life.\nHere, it is interesting to ask whether Dong\u0026rsquo;s view has any merit. It is clear that he overstates the case for human agency. Not everything that happens is our fault. At the same time, he understates the extent to which the world is genuinely anomalous, and unexpectedness is simply the way of things. Even with an ideal political and social order, we would not escape this unpredictability.\nNevertheless, there are also genuine insights here. The first is that we can understand a lot about the world by reflecting on the fact that history is far more unpredictable, far more made up of anomalies and chance events, than we might hope. Dong would no doubt agree with Nassim Nicholas Taleb when he argues that to understand history, we need to get to grips with so-called “black swans”, improbable events with enormous consequences.\nThe other insight is that the knock-on effects of unvirtuous government may be both wide-ranging and unexpected. Droughts, fires, floods may seem like natural disasters; but many of these things may also have their roots, at least in part, in human agency. Bad government can amplify the bad effects of living in a world that is never wholly predictable. Good government can diminish these bad effects.\nAnd here Dong Zhongshu might offer us a challenge, as we face our current climate disaster: the challenge of asking what it might mean to rule in a way that contributes to life\u0026rsquo;s flourishing.\nNotes [1] Stephen Durrant, Wai-yee Li and David Schaberg (translators), Zuo Tradition Zuozhuan: Commentary on the “Spring and Autumn Annals” (University of Washington Press 2016) p. 147\n[2] Michael Loewe, Dong Zhongshu, a \u0026lsquo;Confucian\u0026rsquo; Heritage and the Chunqiu Fanlu (Brill 2011), p. 48.\n[3] ibid. p. 50\n[4] Durrant et al., Zuo Tradition Zuozhuan, p. 331\n[5] ibid. p. 331\n[6] Sarah A.

            "title": "Kaṇāda\u0027s Search for a Soul Without Qualities",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "The Soul and Other Long-standing Problems What is the soul? What is our innermost essence? What makes us, most deeply, who we are?\nWhen faced by this question, the temptation is to go straight to our uniqueness. What makes me me is that I have unique, singular, specific qualities. This uniqueness and singularity is what is most deeply, and most fundamentally, who I am.\nBut for the Indian philosopher Kaṇāda, the opposite is true. And the culmination of the philosophical quest, the true meaning of liberation, is the attainment of a soul almost entirely without qualities.\nOh, Kaṇāda Perhaps appropriately, given his philosophical aims, Kaṇāda (कणाद) is a shadowy figure. Like a spy, or an undercover agent, in the Sanskrit texts he has multiple names. He is Kaṇāda. He is Kāśyapa. He is Kaṇabhakṣa, literally the “eater of atoms”. More mysteriously, he is Ulūka, “the Owl.” This latter nickname may not be entirely complimentary. Owls in Ancient India did not have the positive connotations of wisdom that they have in the European tradition; and while Ulūka was sometimes used as an epithet for the god Indra, owls were as often associated with carrion and with scavenging.\nIf pinning down Kaṇāda\u0026rsquo;s name is hard, it\u0026rsquo;s even harder to say anything about the historical person who may or may not lurk behind this name. As usual with early Indian philosophers, Kaṇāda\u0026rsquo;s dates are all over the place. Some argue that he lived as far back as the 6th century before the common era, and others that he dates to the second century CE when the text attributed to him, the Vaiśeṣika-Sūtra, reached something close to its present form.\nBreaking Reality Apart So let\u0026rsquo;s not worry too much about Kaṇāda, and look instead at the text he is said to have authored. One of the central concerns of the Vaiśeṣika-Sūtra is what philosophers call ontology. In other words, the question of what kinds of things exist, how they exist, and what it means to say they exist (ontology comes from the Greek ontos ὄντος, meaning “being”).\nThe Vaiśeṣika-Sūtra sets about answering these ontological questions by analysing the constituent entities that make up the various things of the world.\nAs a starting point, Kaṇāda identifies three categories of existence: substances (dravya), qualities (guṇa) and motions (karma). This is relatively straightforward: it simply says that there are things or substances, with particular qualities, acting in particular ways. For example, I am a particular kind of thing (a human being), with particular qualities (the colour of my eyes, my liking for philosophy), acting in particular ways (I write, I drink coffee, I seek the company of cats).\n(In addition to these three categories, the Vaiśeṣika tradition recognises three additional categories: sāmānya, meaning “generality”; viśeṣa, meaning “particularity”; and samavāya, meaning “inherence.” But let\u0026rsquo;s leave this extra complication on one side, and stick with substance, quality, and motion. Otherwise, we\u0026rsquo;ll be here all day.)\nIf the world is made up of dravya or substances, Kaṇāda goes on to ask what it means to be a substance. Here, he posits that behind the complex, multifaceted facade of the world, there is a far simpler reality.\nThere are, Kaṇāda posits, nine fundamental, underlying atomic substances, four of which are material (earth, water, fire, and air), and five of which are immaterial (ether, time, space, self, and mind). This tendency to break things down into smaller units is not unlike that of the Greek atomist philosopher Democritus and his heirs. And it\u0026rsquo;s worth noting in passing that Kaṇāda\u0026rsquo;s four material substances – earth, water, fire, and air – are the same as those claimed by the philosopher Empedocles.\nAs for qualities (guṇa) and motions (karma), Kaṇāda goes on to argue that there are seventeen fundamental qualities, ranging from things like taste, touch and smell, to pleasure and pain, to size and number. And, he says, there are five kinds of motion: up, down, contracting, expanding and going (see for comparison the various Aztec notions of motion-change).\nIn Search of Illumination Christopher Wood: Girl and Lamp in a Cornish Window 1928. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nSo far, so good. But before we get in too deep or too tangled (and Vaiśeṣika thought gets complex very fast), we should probably step back and ask a question: Why does any of this matter? And here we have to remember that philosophers in the ancient world almost always have a vision of human potential to sell us. Democritus, for example, argued that his atomism could help us develop euthymia or good cheer. So what about Kaṇāda?\nLike the Greek atomists, the owlish philosopher is interested in more than armchair speculation. But he has far bigger things in his sights than mere cheerfulness.\nA Soul Without Qualities The opening section of the Vaiśeṣika-Sūtra begins, “now, therefore, we will explain dharma.”\nBut what is dharma? It is a multifaceted word in the philosophical traditions of India, with shades of meaning that range from “duty” to “ordering principle” to “ultimate truth”. Fortunately, Kaṇāda lets us know what he is driving at. “Dharma,” he says, “is that from which there is achievement of elevation and liberation.” [1]\nHere, Kaṇāda is consistent with a much broader Indian tradition that sees human life as being caught within a cycle of rebirth, driven by ignorance. And, in line with this broader tradition, for Kaṇāda, knowledge and insight are profoundly liberative. As the commentator Candrānanda puts it,\nby the knowledge of differences and similarities between substances and so forth, through the production of knowledge [obtained] by the means of ‘detachment’ [from the world] \u0026hellip; there is achievement of ‘absolute liberation.’ [2]\nHere, we might perhaps pause to take this in. Here is a complex treatise on the fundamental building-blocks of reality. But the driving force behind Kaṇāda\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is not just knowledge of the world, having interesting thoughts or finding out stuff about the world. It is complete liberation.\nHowever, there are many kinds of liberation. So what does Kaṇāda\u0026rsquo;s liberation look like? And certainly, at first glance, this vision of liberation may seem a strange one. In some ways, it is easier to say what it is not than what it is.\nIt is not full knowledge. In fact, goes beyond knowledge altogether. It is not a state of bliss because it precludes feeling. And for this same reason, it is not happiness.\nInstead, it is a state where we have gone beyond knowledge, where the ātman, or the self, loses all of its distinctive specific qualities. Liberation, Kaṇāda argues, is a state when we have forever gone beyond sensation, beyond pleasure and pain, beyond cognition, and beyond knowledge.\nThis may seem like a curious the kind of thing to aspire to. You might ask: can this state of absence even be anything at all? Why would anybody conceive of such a state, let alone see it as desirable?\nAnd here, it may be useful to put Vaiśeṣika thought in the context of another aspect of the Indian tradition: the long tradition of meditative practice. Within the meditative practices of the Indian tradition, what might be called “contentless” states of absorption are well-known. These are states where one withdraws from the sense objects, awareness of pleasure and pain, cognition and even a sense of selfhood.\nThe notion of such states might cause philosophers in other traditions a measure of discomfort. But these meditative experiences of what Olaf Blanke and Thomas Metzinger have called Minimal Phenomenal Selfhood are increasingly well-attested and broadly studied.\nWhat is important in understanding Indian philosophy is that the acknowledgement of the existence of such states is a part of the general philosophical background. And when seen in this light, we can start to make more sense of Kaṇāda\u0026rsquo;s notion of the final goal of philosophy. He\u0026rsquo;s not just making things up or playing with words. Instead, he\u0026rsquo;s talking about experiences that were well-known among his peers and predecessors; and he is using these experiences as a peg on which to hang his metaphysical speculations.\nThe result is a curiously challenging (and perhaps to some of us not immediately appealing) view of the ultimate end of human life. Liberation, Kaṇāda want to tell us, is an emptying out of everything that might distinguish us as unique and singular.\nIt is becoming a soul almost without qualities. Because this is what we most deeply are.\nNotes Ionut Moise and Ganesh U. Thite (2021), Vaiśeṣikasūtra, Routledge, p. 55 ibid. p. 263 ",

            "content": "The Silent Reader There\u0026rsquo;s a story that Saint Augustine (354 – 430 CE) tells about his meeting with Ambrose, the bishop of Milan. When Augustine turned up in Milan, it was in search of a teacher of rhetoric. And Ambrose was considered one of the best.\nAt the time, Augustine\u0026rsquo;s philosophical and religious commitments were to the doctrines of Manichaeanism. He was unimpressed by Ambrose\u0026rsquo;s Catholic teachings, even while he was impressed by his new mentor\u0026rsquo;s kindness and rhetorical skill. And at first, he managed to keep the two apart: the medium and the message, the teachings of Ambrose, and his skill in delivering them.\nBut as time went on, the lines between the two became blurred. The more Augustine enjoyed Ambrose\u0026rsquo;s rhetoric, the more the content of what Ambrose was saying entered into his mind. Before long, Augustine had gone through an existential and philosophical transformation. Rhetoric, the power of the spoken voice, can do that to you sometimes.\nBut there was something else odd about Ambrose as well, something that fascinated Augustine. When Ambrose read, he did so in silence. This is how Augustine puts it in his Confessions. It\u0026rsquo;s such a beautiful passage, it is worth quoting in full.\nWhen he was reading, his eyes ran over the page and his heart perceived the sense, but his voice and tongue were silent. He did not restrict access to anyone coming in, nor was it customary even for a visitor to be announced. Very often when we were there, we saw him silently reading and never otherwise. After sitting for a long time in silence (for who would dare to burden him in such intent concentration?) we used to go away. We supposed that in the brief time he could find for his mind’s refreshment, free from the hubbub of other people’s troubles, he would not want to be invited to consider another problem. We wondered if he read silently perhaps to protect himself in case he had a hearer interested and intent on the matter, to whom he might have to expound the text being read if it contained difficulties, or who might wish to debate some difficult questions. If his time were used up in that way, he would get through fewer books than he wished. Besides, the need to preserve his voice, which used easily to become hoarse, could have been a very fair reason for silent reading. Whatever motive he had for his habit, this man had a good reason for what he did.[1]\nScholars are divided on what this means. Does it mean that nobody ever read silently back in Augustine\u0026rsquo;s day? Or is what is significant here the fact that Ambrose was silently reading in the company of others when the expectation would be that reading, if not done alone, was something to be shared?\nEither way, for readers such as ourselves here in the present day, there is something astonishing about Augustine\u0026rsquo;s astonishment. We see silent reading as something so very natural, so very ordinary, we don\u0026rsquo;t really think about it. For us, reading and silent reading are synonymous. Reading is solitary, not social. It is one reason that we love it. And (if Augustine is right), perhaps it is one reason that Ambrose loved it as well: so that he could protect himself from conversation and other people\u0026rsquo;s troubles.\nBut for much of human history, reading has been a largely social activity rather than a solitary one, something that is done with the body and the tongue and the mouth, something that is shared.\nAugustine and Ambrose. From a painting by Fra Filippo Lippi c. 1437. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Silent Horror of Reading Husserl So what does this have to do with reading philosophy, even if you are reading it alone? Let me tell you a story about when I was studying for my PhD.\nI did my PhD on the work of Emmanuel Levinas. At the time, I was a practising Buddhist, and I was perplexed by the excessive ethical demands of the Mahayana Buddhist traditions: by the idea that we have an ethical responsibility towards all other beings. Somewhere along the way, as I was working through all this, I stumbled across Levinas. I was intrigued by Levinas because he argued that our ethical responsibilities increase in the measure to which we assume them. In other words, the more ethically responsive you are, the more your responsibilities deepen. For Levinas, there is never a point at which you can say, “I have done enough.” The more you do, the more there is to do. In short: ethics is infinite.\nI was obsessed with this idea for a long time. So I started a PhD on Levinas (the Buddhism fell by the wayside, but that\u0026rsquo;s another story…). And from the first, I found Levinas is a tricky writer to get to grips with, his prose tangled and often obscure. I was reassured that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just me: Levinas himself admitted that his work presents us with a “thicket of difficulties.” And the phenomenological tradition of which he was a part, founded by his teacher Edmund Husserl, was famous for its dense, technical language. So I knuckled down and started reading.\nBut it turned out that Levinas was not the worst of it. And after a couple of years of reading Levinas, I realised that to properly get to grips with what he was up to, I\u0026rsquo;d have to read Husserl as well. So I picked up the Cartesian Meditations, an introductory text by Husserl that Levinas himself translated into French. From the first, I found Husserl to be truly, deeply, maddeningly horrible to read. Worse, far worse, than Levinas.\nAs the Cartesian Meditations started, things didn\u0026rsquo;t seem too bad. The introduction to the book was okay, more or less. It was almost friendly. But by page ten, all hell had been let loose, and I found myself beginning to drown. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example (although you can scroll past the quote if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to give yourself a headache: it\u0026rsquo;s not important to my argument here):\nHere belongs, first of all, an initial clarification of “judicative” doing and the “judgement” itself, along with the discrimination of immediate and mediate judgements: mediate judgements have such a sense-relatedness to other judgements that judicatively believing them “presupposes” believing these others in the manner characteristic of a believing on account of something believed already. Also clarification of the striving for grounded judgements, clarification of the grounding doing, in which the “correctness”, the “truth” of the judgement should be shown or, in case of a failure, the / incorrectness, the falsity, of the judgement. [2]\nFrom here on in, things got worse and worse. My eyes skimmed the page. I nodded sagely along, hoping that clarity would dawn somewhere down the line (remember that it can be good to read philosophy Napoleonically). But by the time I got to the end (with a quote from Augustine, no less, telling us “Do not desire to go outwards, but go back into yourself. Truth dwells in our inward person”), I had to admit defeat.\nI had understood pretty much nothing. I had not a damn clue what was going on.\nHusserl as Performance Art But I wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be defeated. So I decided to take a different approach. I got up from my armchair (philosophers always have armchairs: it is the law). I turned back to the first page. And I started to pace around, reading Husserl\u0026rsquo;s clogged and difficult sentences out loud. The strategy I settled on was this:\nFirst, read a sentence or two out loud. Next, elaborate on the sentence, also out loud, as if giving a lecture to an invisible audience. Then, when I get to the end of the passage, sit down and make notes on my understanding (at the time, I wrote on a manual typewriter: it was more or less an affectation. My housemate was very tolerant). At the end of the chapter, pace around and read the notes out loud. My tolerant housemate left me to my eccentricities as I turned the sitting room into a kind of phenomenological performance art space. I worked through the text slowly and painstakingly. I recited Husserl\u0026rsquo;s text, adding little dramatic flourishes, waving my hands in the air, pausing for effect in front of my imagined audience, injecting little moments of drama into his prose.\nAnd as I continued, I found that reading like this, I was understanding more and more. Reading out loud brought the text alive in a way reading silently didn\u0026rsquo;t. Not only this, but reading Husserl became almost (and I say almost advisedly) fun.\nRe-incarnating Speech We are sometimes told that talking to ourselves is a sign of madness. And I must have looked pretty crazy pacing back and forth blathering on about Husserl. But since that time, I have become a convert to the idea that we should read philosophy out loud, breaking our habit of silent reading. Because reading out loud can do things that silent reading can\u0026rsquo;t do nearly as well.\nBildet er hentet fra Nasjonalbibliotekets bildesamling. Public domain, national library of Norway. Via Wikimedia Commons.\nBut what things? I think there are at least three benefits: reading out loud can make new connections and help us learn; it can get our body involved in our reading, thus cementing and deepening our learning; and it can remind us that thinking is never as solitary as we might believe.\nBack when I was studying anthropology, one of my anthropology professors liked to say that talking to yourself was a way of making a virtual connection between different parts of your brain. When internal connections are a bit tangled, why not speak out loud and funnel those words from the speaking bit of your brain, back through your ears into the listening bit of your brain? It\u0026rsquo;s not as if everything we think or know, or think we know, is apparent to us. Our brains are complex things, and our thoughts are not fully transparent to ourselves. So this isn\u0026rsquo;t just about reinforcing what we already know, but instead about how through self-talk we can learn genuinely new stuff.\nBut also, perhaps there is something about how speaking words out loud and hearing them makes words flesh once again. Silent reading can feel thin and abstract. But speaking out loud serves to re-incarnate language. It gets our body to sing along with our mind. It makes our hands dance like an orchestral conductor, tracing the shape of thoughts in the air. And this allows the words we are reading to settle more deeply into our physical, embodied experience of the world.\nAnd finally, there is something about speaking out loud, even if we are on our own, that seems to rescue us from solitude, and return us to a sense of ourselves as social beings, and our thoughts as not just private, but social. Think of how, reading Husserl out loud, I imagined I was lecturing to an audience, making sure that I understood what I was saying well enough to communicate it to others, pausing to make sure my (imagined) audience understood. This virtual, imagined audience helped me gauge whether I myself had really understood what I was saying. And when this imagined audience seemed sceptical, I found myself rephrasing and reshaping what I was saying so that they could make more sense of it.\nThis suggests to me that when getting to grips with difficult philosophy, perhaps we should depart from the advice of both Husserl and Augustine. We should not desire to go back into ourselves, but should go outwards, speaking out loud, breaking with the solitude of inner thought, letting words become flesh. And perhaps then we might find understanding at last beginning to dawn.\nSo the next time you have a difficult philosophy text that you can\u0026rsquo;t get to grips with, here\u0026rsquo;s a suggestion. Why not speak it out loud? Why not wave your arms around, sing it, holler it or whisper it? When you do so, you will start to feel the text coursing through your body. It will come alive. And the knots and difficulties in the text may find themselves unravelling, almost magically, so that you finally come to understand.\nRead the whole series on seven ways of reading philosophy\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "content": "Learning to Play At the moment, I\u0026rsquo;m endeavouring to improve my rudimentary jazz piano playing. It\u0026rsquo;s a long process: I\u0026rsquo;ve played on and off for years, without really getting any better. So this year, now I\u0026rsquo;ve been reunited with my keyboard, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to put some more time in, hoping that I can make some small, incremental improvements. It\u0026rsquo;s fun, fascinating and sometimes frustrating.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a lot to learn: all that theory, that experience of listening to music, that feeling of what the music is like in your bones. And in this process of learning, I\u0026rsquo;ve found help from a curious source: the Greek philosopher Ptolemaïs, who lived sometime between the third century BCE and the first century CE.\nOn singing beasts But before we get on to Ptolemaïs and who she was, let\u0026rsquo;s get back to basics. What is music, anyway? Of all the weird things that human beings get up to, listening to and playing music is one of the weirdest. We sing, we yodel, we tap our feet, we dance, we sway, we chant, we holler.\nIn our love of music, we may not be alone in the animal kingdom. Cetaceans sing complex songs, often in harmony.[1] Warblers warble. Yellowhammers hammer on endlessly about little bits of bread with no cheese. And certainly, in some philosophical traditions, the power of music was seen as something that could extend beyond the human realm.\nFor the philosophers of ancient China, creatures other than ourselves were considered to be susceptible to music. So, for example, philosopher Wang Chong (c. 27 – 100 CE) wrote that “birds and beasts are fond of sentimental sounds, their ears are similar to human ears.” And according to the philosophical text called the Han Feizi, Duke Ping of Jin, in the sixth century BCE, could play music to make cranes flap their wings and dance. Meanwhile, a thirteenth-century Persian text has Plato sending wild beasts into a trance by playing the organ.\nNevertheless, few animals seem so wholly obsessed by music as human beings. We just can\u0026rsquo;t seem to stop ourselves. And so it is not surprising that this musical compulsion has been something that has long perplexed philosophers, from ancient times down to the present day.\nHarmony, number and the universe The ancient Greek world was full of music. As Flora Levin writes in her book, Greek Reflections on the Nature of Music, “the peoples of Ancient Greece surrounded themselves with music; they immersed themselves in music; they were in fact imbued with music. Scarcely any social or human function, whether public or private, urban or rural, took place without its musical accompaniment” [3]. So it is no surprise that Greek philosophers found themselves chewing over the question of what music is, why we do it, and what its significance is.\nThe earliest musical theories in Ancient Greece are associated with Pythagoras in the 6th century BCE. Pythagoras was responsible for the substantial insight that music is underpinned by mathematics. For Pythagoras, the whole world functions in accordance with musical harmony, making mathematics the underlying basis for everything.\nThe philosopher from Cyrene One of the leading Pythagorean philosophers of music was the woman philosopher Ptolemaïs of Cyrene. We don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Ptolemaïs\u0026rsquo;s life. As her name suggests, she was from Cyrene, the home also of Arete of Cyrene and the Cyrenaic philosophers. Although she wrote a treatise on music called The Pythagorean Doctrine of the Elements of Music, of which everything has been lost, except for some tantalising fragments.\nIn these remaining fragments, Ptolemaïs tackles a debate that was raging in the ancient philosophical world. Does the essence of music lie in intellect and reason? Or does it lie in bodily sensation?\nReason and sensation in understanding music The Pythagoreans had long argued that the essence of music lay in its mathematical exactitude. But there is a problem with this intellectualist approach. If you see the foundations of music as lying in reason alone, you risk making music something refined and bloodless. And this is not our usual experience of music. After all, even if music is underpinned by mathematics, our relationship with music begins elsewhere: in the experience or sensation of sound.\nThis is why the philosopher Aristoxenus of Tarentum (born c. 375 BCE), a disciple of Aristotle, argued that it is experience, or sensation, that should be the starting point for our reflections on music. In his treatise Elements of Harmony, Aristoxenus argued that when we play music, we are not just attending to questions of mathematical proportion: we are also listening and sensing.\nThis led to a debate in ancient Greek music theory between those for whom sensation was foremost, and those for whom reason was foremost.\nPtolemaïs sets out the debate in a passage preserved in the work of the third-century Syrian-Roman philosopher Porphyry. In this passage, Ptolemaïs distinguishes between two kinds of approaches to thinking about music.\nOn the one hand, there are those who theorise about music in terms of “the science of kanonikē,” a term that she says derives from a root meaning “straight” (the Greek word “κανών” means “a straight rod or a bar”). These are the Pythagorean mathematical theorists.\nOn the other hand, there are the mousikoi, who are “harmonic theorists who begin from the perceptions [or sensations]” [4]. These are largely the followers of Aristoxenus (if not necessarily) Aristoxenus himself.\n1913 piano advertisement. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe way that Ptolemaïs enters into this debate is nuanced. Despite the appearance of stark differences, these two approaches cannot be entirely disentangled. The Pythagoreans, she says, for all their commitments, don\u0026rsquo;t entirely overlook sensation. Nor can they. For them, sensation provides the “spark” that lights the fires of their mathematical investigations. And you have to have heard music for it to be something that you can reflect on. However, once they have got going, the Pythagoreans focus only on reason and leave sensation alone.\nOn the other hand, the followers of Aristoxenus start from the practical experience of actually producing music. But they don\u0026rsquo;t entirely neglect reason. Instead, they see sensation “as authoritative, and reason as attending on it, for use only when needed” [4].\nLearning to play: insights from Ptolemaïs So which is the right approach? If you really want to get music, should you become a follower of the Pythagoreans? Or should you rely on empirical approaches, like some of Aristoxenus\u0026rsquo;s followers? The answer that Ptolemaïs gives is this: you should do both. This is what she writes:\nFor what is perceived cannot be constituted by itself apart from reason, and neither is reason strong enough to establish anything without taking its starting points [archai] from sensation, and delivering the conclusion of its theorising [theorēma] in agreement with sensation once again. [5]\nPtolemaïs argues that Aristoxenus has been misinterpreted. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to say that sensation is first in terms of power. Instead, he wants to say that it is first in terms of priority. We have to hear music before we can do any thinking about it at all. But in this thinking, both the experience of music – listening to music or making music – and the act of reasoning about music are equally important.\nLet me end by going back to the example I opened with. Why am I learning to play the piano? Why even bother? One reason is that I grew up listening to Oscar Peterson records. That is sensation. It is first in terms of priority. It was one of the reasons that I came to love music.\nHowever, the more I practice, the more I am finding I need to do two things simultaneously. I need to keep on spending time reflecting on music – thinking through intervals, the circle of fifths, harmonic sequences and so on. But I also need to keep spending time making and listening to music – training my ear and my body and my senses.\nNeither of these approaches is sufficient on its own. And as I sit down at my keyboard, Ptolemaïs provides me with a useful reminder that the arts of music are both sensory and intellectual.\nNotes [1] See the nice summary by W. T.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Philosophy in times of strife The Chinese Legalist philosopher Han Fei (韓非) (281-233 BCE) was born a member of the royal household in the small state of Han. What we know about Han Fei comes from the unreliable Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian. The stories may not be entirely trustworthy, but we do know that the context of Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s life was one of the political strife that marked the centuries known in China as the Warring States period (dating from 476 to 221 BCE).\nHan Fei studied with the Confucian philosopher Xunzi, who argued that human nature was crooked and in need of correction. There was ample evidence for this view in the brutal political context of Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s day. But Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s thinking departed from that of his teacher. Where Xunzi emphasised the role of ritual in correcting our wayward natures, for Han Fei, the main instrument of correction was law: the apportioning of punishments and rewards.\nLike many philosophers of his day, Han Fei aspired to become a political advisor. But he was hampered by one problem: according to Sima Qian, Han Fei had a stutter. This was a serious impediment in the courts of his day. For political advisors, glibness and fluency were a means to getting noticed. And it was all too easy to dismiss Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s thinking on account of his difficulty in speaking.\nBut if Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s stutter hampered his ability to persuade the ruler of Han of the coherence of his ideas, it also gave fuel to his writing: when he could not gain the ear of the ruler of Han, he decided to write his ideas down.\nThe philosopher and the poison Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s writings did not take hold in his home state. But over in neighbouring Qin, the ruler, King Zheng (later to become Qin Shihuang, the First Emperor of terracotta army fame) was impressed. When Qin launched an attack on the neighbouring state of Han, the king of Han sent Han Fei as an emissary to negotiate peace.\n18th-century image of Qin Shihuang. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe ruler of Qin was at first excited to welcome Han Fei into his court, and was impressed by his ideas. But there was already a philosopher-in-residence in the Qin court, a former fellow student of Xunzi\u0026rsquo;s called Li Si. Perhaps worried that his position was under threat, Li persuaded king Zheng that Han Fei could not be trusted. He had Han Fei imprisoned on trumped-up charges of double-dealing, and then promptly dispatched poison to the prison.\nKnowing he had no other way out, Han Fei took the poison, thus ending his life.\nHan Fei\u0026rsquo;s philosophy The book that is attributed to Han Fei, known as the Han Feizi, (the book of Master Han Fei), was compiled by Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s disciples after his death. As with many texts from this era, the authorship has been contested, but the consensus is that at least the greater part of the Han Feizi was written by Han Fei.\nHan Fei\u0026rsquo;s philosophy has multiple roots. He takes an abiding concern with human selfishness from his mentor Xunzi. He argues for the regulatory function of law, in the tradition of earlier philosophers from the tendency in Chinese philosophy known as fa jia (法家), usually translated as “Legalism.” And he takes ideas from the Daoist traditions, in particular the idea of non-doing or wu wei, but reimagines this non-doing in the context of the ruthlessness of court life.\nThe malleability of human nature For Han Fei\u0026rsquo;s teacher, Xunzi, goodness is not natural, but artificial. We are bad by nature; but we make ourselves and our lives good and beautiful by crafting ourselves, the way a carpenter might bend, straighten and craft wood. There are many ways that we might do this: one is the kind of system of punishments and rewards that Han Fei also approved of; another is the use of ritual as a form of collective and individual cultivation.\nHowever, Han Fei departs from his teacher in several respects, one of which was his insistence that the old debate about the goodness or badness (see here) of human nature was ultimately fruitless. For Han Fei, human nature is changeable and malleable: we live, he claimed, in accord with our circumstances. So the point is not to straighten out an already crooked nature. Instead, it is to put in place a framework so that this changeability of our natures can be regulated and developed.[1] And one of the best ways of doing this is by the institution of law.\nLaw, method, and impersonal charisma The legalist tradition in Chinese philosophy is sometimes traced as far back as the philosopher Guan Zhong (see the link here). It is a tradition that emphasises the role of law or fa – the balance of punishments and rewards – in maintaining social order. For legalist philosophers such as Han Fei, the role of a ruler is to bring about both unity and order within the state. And the primary instrument through which the ruler does this is through putting in place a system of law that will serve to regulate human behaviour.\nA system of law that is clear, unambiguous and applied rigorously has the advantage of making human behaviour systematic: it channels our wayward natures into behaving in ways that support the power and unity of the state, and it punishes those who undermine this power and unity.\nBut law is not sufficient for the good running of the state. Han Fei also employs two other concepts that are important within political life. The first is shu (術), which can be translated as “artfulness” or “method.” This is about how the ruler maintains their administration, to offset the danger of the power of the law being usurped. And the second is shi (勢), meaning potency or charisma.\nThe notion of charisma or potency in Han Fei is not about personal charisma: it is best for the people to know nothing at all about the ruler as an individual. But projecting a sense of impersonal charisma or potency helps underpin the law with a sense of unshakeable necessity.\nRuling by doing nothing This idea of impersonal charisma may be puzzling. But here Han Fei reaches for a concept from the traditions of Daoist thought to make sense of it. And this concept is that of non-doing, or wu wei (無為).\nAt first glance, this might seem like the opposite of a political idea. How can one govern by non-doing? What does this mean? For Han Fei, the idea is this. A monarch who parades around looking like a monarch, who endlessly and heroically acts, becomes an easy target for their enemies. But there is something much more terrifying about a monarch who is not seen to act, who is almost invisible, and who rules with ease and confidence in accord with the inflexible law.\nThis is the kind of inaccessible, impersonal ruler who strikes fear in the heart of their subordinates. And this is the kind of rule that ultimately endures. At least in theory (although in practice, Qin Shihuang\u0026rsquo;s empire was short-lived).\nHere is what Han Feizi says, in the translation by Burton Watson.\nThe ruler must not reveal his desires; for if he reveals his desires his ministers will put on the mask that pleases him. He must not reveal his will; for if he does so his ministers will show a different face. So it is said: Discard likes and dislikes and the ministers will show their true form; discard wisdom and wile and the ministers will watch their step. Hence, though the ruler is wise, he hatches no schemes from his wisdom, but causes all men to know their place. Though he has worth, he does not display it in his deeds, but observes the motives of his ministers. Though he is brave, he does not flaunt his bravery in shows of indignation, but allows his subordinates to display their valor to the full. Thus, though he discards wisdom, his rule is enlightened; though he discards worth, he achieves merit; and though he discards bravery, his state grows powerful. When the ministers stick to their posts, the hundred officials have their regular duties, and the ruler employs each according to his particular ability, this is known as the state of manifold constancy.\nHence it is said: “So still he seems to dwell nowhere at all; so empty no one can seek him out.” The enlightened ruler reposes in nonaction above, and below his ministers tremble with fear. [2]\nFor the Han Feizi, the effective strategy for ruling, and the most powerful source of charisma, is to be as bland as possible. It is a charisma of no charisma, an emptiness that exudes power. And what could be more terrifying than that?\nNotes [1] See Alejandro Bárcenas\u0026rsquo;s paper \u0026lsquo;Xunzi and Han Fei on Human Nature,\u0026rsquo; in International Philosophical Quarterly 52:1, issue 2016 (June 2012).\n[2] Burton Watson (2003), Han Feizi: Basic Writings, Columbia University Press, pp. 15-16.\nFurther reading Try François Jullien\u0026rsquo;s In Praise of Blandness (Zone Books 2004), to explore the curious idea of how having no personal style, no flavour or no taste may turn out, paradoxically, to be a powerful thing!\n",

            "content": "Does philosophy change our minds? Philosophers talk a lot about the power of reasoned argument to change our minds. The whole discipline of philosophy, to an extent, depends on the idea that this is how argument works.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s a problem with this idea. Because one thing that you notice if you hang around philosophers for a while is that in practice, they don\u0026rsquo;t change their minds very often. Surely, one might think, if reasoned debate were really this transformative, then their skill in the use of reason would lead to them changing their minds with a quicksilver frequency that would put the rest of us to shame. They\u0026rsquo;d be hard to pin down, slippery as fish, constantly on the move. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to work like this. Instead, philosophers (or at least the ones I know) seem, if anything, to change their minds less than non-philosophers.\nPerhaps this is not surprising. Philosophers spend a lot of time and energy defending their arguments. And after all this effort, when everything that you thought you knew turns out to be wrong, or when the edifice of your beliefs begins to crumble, then it\u0026rsquo;s hard to face up to this. There\u0026rsquo;s something uniquely difficult about changing your mind, even more so when you have staked your entire life and reputation on a particular set of arguments or beliefs. Changing your mind can make new enemies of those who once considered you a friend. And it can invite ridicule. Think of how politicians are held to account by the media for changing their mind, and how these reversals are referred to as “humiliating U-turns.”\nSo in this philosopher file, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at two philosophers from the ancient Greek world who changed their minds. The first is Timocrates of Lampsacus (born around the late 4th century BCE), who turned his back on the philosophy of Epicurus. And the second is the Dionysius the Renegade, his rough contemporary, who embraced, and then turned his back on, the Stoic school of Zeno.\nTimocrates renounces Epicureanism For the Epicurean philosophers, pleasure is the highest good. To put the philosophy in a nutshell, for the followers of Epicurus, there is no other good but pleasure. This being the case, we need to get smarter about pleasure. After all, the Epicureans argued, pleasure is not something we\u0026rsquo;re very good at. Many of the pleasures we seek entail pain and discomfort. We seek pleasure and end up with the opposite. So a life dedicated to pleasure is one where we need to think harder about the pleasures we seek, and distinguish between them more carefully.\nTimocrates became a member of the Epicurean community, along with his brother Metrodorus. Timocrates\u0026rsquo;s brother was one of Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s closest friends, but Timocrates himself was less impressed by Epicurus and his followers. He left the sect, unconvinced by the claim that pleasure was the highest good. Having left the school of Epicurus, Timocrates wrote a work called On Nature. The book contained furious attacks on Epicurus. He claimed that Epicurus was poor at reasoning, tediously repetitious in his writing, given to over-indulgence to the point of vomiting, disdainful of pretty much everyone, and addicted to sensual pleasures.\nAdvertisement for wine. Friedrich Karl Georg Rumpf (1910). Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nUnsurprisingly, this led to a rift between the two brothers (there\u0026rsquo;s nothing that the history books like more than tales of two warring brothers). Diogenes Laërtius tells us that Metrodorus remained a disciple of Epicurus, and he wrote furious refutations of his brother\u0026rsquo;s accusations, including a book called Against Timocrates.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to know how much credit to give Timocrates\u0026rsquo;s criticisms. Although similar charges against Epicurus were repeated for centuries afterwards, many of them drawing on Timocrates\u0026rsquo;s lurid accusations, other accounts of Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s life and person paint a picture of Epicurus as much more restrained and abstemious. And as Timocrates\u0026rsquo;s On Nature has not survived, we don\u0026rsquo;t know what kind of philosophy he embraced after leaving Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s school. Diogenes does say, however, that Timocrates made a “minor career” out of pouring slander on Epicurus.\nDionysius renounces Stoicism Timocrates\u0026rsquo;s contemporary, Dionysius the Renegade, had a conversion that was in some ways the mirror-image of that of Timocrates. Dionysius started his philosophical life as a follower of the philosopher Heraclides Ponticus, a man whose brilliance was only matched by his pomposity.\nHowever, Dionysius and Heraclides fell out after Dionysius perpetrated a literary hoax. He claimed to have discovered a lost work of Sophocles, although he\u0026rsquo;d actually authored the play himself. Heraclides was taken in, and he cited the forgery in his own work, sure that it was authored by the great playwright. At this point, Dionysius confessed to the hoax. Unwilling to admit he was wrong, Heraclides insisted that the work was genuine. It was only when Dionysius revealed an acrostic hidden in the text claiming that Heraclides was an “old monkey”, who was “ignorant of literature” that Heraclides had to admit he was wrong. [1]\nHeraclides was furious at being taken in so easily. Unsurprisingly, the hoax led to the two of them parting ways. Next, Dionysius became a follower of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic school. Stoicism emphasised the pursuit of virtue over the pursuit of pleasure. The goal of Stoicism was an understanding of necessity, and an imperturbable, steady and unwavering commitment to living in accord with virtue. This seemed to have served Dionysius well for a while, until he came down with a terrible eye infection.\nFor another philosopher, this might have been a chance to put his Stoic commitments to the test, to tough it out. But Dionysius chose otherwise. He left the Stoic school, and instead became a member of the Cyrenaic school who, like the Epicureans, emphasised pleasure.\nFor the Cyrenaics, pleasure was defined as the “smooth motion of the flesh” (this contrasted with the Epicurean view of true pleasure as being essentially static). And for somebody afflicted by physical pain, perhaps the philosophy of the Cyrenaics was appealing to Dionysius: it may have provided a way forward that was not simply about bearing the suffering of his infection, but was instead about cultivating what pleasure he could.\nPredictably, the Stoics were no less outraged by his defection than the Epicureans were by the defection of Timocrates (despite all that Stoic training in imperturbability). They claimed Dionysius had fallen into vice and indolence (much the same claim that Timocrates levelled against Epicurus), that he spent the remainder of his days frequenting brothels, and that he was only interested in sensual pleasure.\nOnce again, it would be good to have access to Dionysius\u0026rsquo;s own words to better appreciate his later phase philosophy. He wrote books both during his Stoic and during his Cyrenaic years, including On Apathy and On Pleasure. But none of these books has survived.\nChanging your mind What can we take away from these stories of renegade philosophers?\nThe first thing we can take away is that stories like these point to the cult-like fervour of various philosophical traditions in the ancient Greek world. The savagery of criticism and the extraordinary bitterness of disputes on both sides – particularly when philosophers like Timocrates and Dionysius went rogue – puts even contemporary university philosophy departments to shame. And that is saying something.\nThe second thing is the idea that the trajectories of individual philosophers in the ancient world were often more existentially charged, more messy, and more turbulent than our romanticised views of ancient truth-seekers. Sibling rivalry and jealousy, the hunger for status, character clashes, eye infections and other bodily ailments, the accidents of chance and of personal biography… all these things were part of what drove philosophers, then as now.\nAnd finally, perhaps, these stories remind us that although philosophy claims to be about changing our minds, the history of philosophy has not necessarily treated well those who have radically changed their minds. So be warned. If you are a philosopher, you go rogue at your own risk.\nNotes [1] This entertaining story is told in Lives of the Philosophers: Diogenes Laertius, translated by Pamela Mensch (Oxford University Press 2018), e-book.\n",

            "content": "The philosophical alchemist The philosopher Zou Yan (鄒衍) lived between 305 and 240CE. He is associated with the so-called Yin Yang School (yinyang jia 陰陽家), also sometimes referred to as the school of Chinese naturalism.\nWhat biographical information we have about Zou Yan comes from Sima Qian\u0026rsquo;s Shiji or Records of the Grand Historian. The Shiji says that Zou Yan came from the state of Qi. His written output was considerable, and it encompassed everything from geography and natural history to history and philosophy. His approach to knowledge was inferential: in pursuit of knowledge, he said, one should first “examine small objects” and from this “draw conclusions about large ones.”\nInterestingly, in the Shiji, Sima Qian writes considerably more about Zou Yan than about the now far more well-known Confucian philosophers Mencius and Xunzi. And there is some evidence that in the context of his time, Zou Yan was a more popular philosopher than the early Confucians. Some accounts say that when Zou Yan turned up at the city gates, the rulers of the city came out to welcome him – the kind of reception the ancient Confucians could only have dreamed of. [1]\nPerhaps part of the appeal was that Zou Yan had a reputation for esoteric arts: he was recognised as a powerful fang shi (方士), an alchemist, magician, or diviner. And what ruler doesn\u0026rsquo;t need a friendly alchemist to help secure their rule?\nZou Yan\u0026rsquo;s thought We don\u0026rsquo;t know much more than this about Zou Yan\u0026rsquo;s life. But according to Sima Qian, Zou Yan was responsible for two ideas that have cemented his role in the shaping of traditional Chinese modes of thought. The first is the idea of yinyang (陰陽), which is familiar enough to have entered popular culture, not only in China but also globally. The second is the idea of wuxing (五行), which is sometimes translated as “five element theory.”\nHowever, wuxing theory is not really about elements in the way that we might understand, for example, Empedocles\u0026rsquo;s view of the four elements. The word xing means “to walk” or “to do” and so is inherently active. This makes “element” a little too static as a translation. The wuxing are not the fundamental building blocks of reality. Instead, they are more like processes or phases, meaning that wuxing is better translated as “five phase”, or “five process” theory.\nUsing the ideas of yinyang and wuxing, Zou Yan argued that underpinning all the processes of the world, from the smallest to the largest, was a single model of change. This model applied equally to cycles of change in the natural world, and those within the realms of politics, culture and human thought.\nYin and yang So, what are yin and yang? At root, they are philosophical concepts that attempt to account for change. The term yin-yang as a pair goes back as far as the Book of Odes or Shijing (詩經), although there it is not given a philosophical gloss. The terms yin and yang also appear in the Daoist classic, the Daodejing, but only fleetingly. There is a single line that claims “the ten thousand things turn away from the shadow (yin) and embrace the light (yang)” (wanwu fu yin er bao yang 萬物負陰而抱陽). To my mind, this is not enough to support the later idea that these were philosophical concepts at the heart of the Daoist text. Instead, this looks more like a description of the light-seeking nature of natural phenomena: for example, how plants stretch out towards the sun.\nIf the Daoist roots of yin and yang are hard to fully establish, there are also no references to yin and yang as philosophical ideas in the earlier Confucian texts. And it is likely that the metaphysical use of these terms was developed as an innovation, either by Zou Yan himself, or at least around the time Zou Yan was flourishing. This gives some weight to Sima Qian\u0026rsquo;s claim that Zou Yan departed from the teachings of the ancients.\nHowever, by the Han dynasty, yinyang theory was everywhere, and had become an integral part of Chinese thought, which it remains down to the present. In this yinyang scheme, the two poles of yin and yang exist in a relationship of creative tension and mutual production. Yin and yang exist in opposition, but they both give rise to each other and overcome each other. Yang correlates with activity, sunlight, the sun and also (the gender politics of yinyang theory are decidedly questionable) maleness; meanwhile, yin correlates with passivity, shadow, the moon, and femaleness. At the centre of everything is the mutually productive interplay and tension of yin and yang.\nFive processes So what about wuxing or “five process” theory? The five processes or wuxing are enumerated as wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. You could see these as representing different qualities of process. More technically, they are seen as representing five kinds of qi (literally “breath”) that underpin the things of the world as they pass through their various transformations.\nLater thinkers developed wuxing theory into a complex set of phase changes. In these systems, each of the wuxing was said to give rise to, or produce, the next, according to the following pattern:\nwood → fire → earth → metal → water → wood\u0026hellip;\nAdditionally – in a rock-paper-scissors fashion – each phase could also be seen to conquer or overcome each other, as follows:\nearth → water → fire → metal → wood → earth\u0026hellip;\nSo each of the four elements is related to each of the others other in a complex set of relationships of either production or overcoming: fire is produced by wood and produces earth, but it is overcome by water and overcomes metal; metal is produced by earth and produces water, but it is overcome by fire and overcomes wood.\nSo how does this relate to the five phases? in Zou Yan\u0026rsquo;s scheme, the yinyang binary was the underpinning “nature” or xing (性) of the wuxing scheme. And the wuxing represented the phenomenal properties or zhi (質) of the yinyang binary.[2]\nThis seems strange. But one way of thinking about this is that in this model, the processes of change at play in the world have different qualities (an idea we have seen also in Aztec philosophy). There are different kinds of change – things change in different ways, according to different rhythms – and understanding change involves getting to grips with this complexity.\nA map of everything (and nothing) From the Han dynasty onwards, this system became increasingly elaborate as a way of trying to map and understand the processes of the world. The five phases could be mapped onto almost everything: compass points, dynasties, flavours, colours, emotions, internal organs, planets, seasons and so on.\nThe obvious trouble with such ways of mapping the world is that schemes such as this risk obscuring as much as they reveal. By shaping all phenomena whatsoever to fit into an increasingly elaborate metaphysical framework, we risk bending the world out of shape or closing ourselves off to phenomena that don\u0026rsquo;t fit the scheme. Or else, in our eagerness to map everything onto this scheme, we find ourselves losing the ability to see anything other than this elaborate framework, regardless of its truth value.\nHowever, this is only one side of the story. Because it is also true that for centuries yinyang and wuxing theories provided a creative impetus for everything from the medical sciences to the arts. Not only this, but in his claim that everything, from small to large, can be understood within a naturalistic framework, Zou Yan has been claimed to be the founder of scientific thought in China.\nNotes [1] Robin R.

            "content": "Obsession and self-medication The philosopher Carneades was born in Cyrene, home of the Cyrenaic philosophers, sometime around 214 BCE. Like many philosophers of his day in the Greek-speaking world, he moved to Athens so he could further his studies.\nContemporary accounts of Carneades paint him as an obsessive, single-minded type. He was so engrossed by his studies that he didn\u0026rsquo;t cut his nails or his hair, and he had to be persuaded to eat, because otherwise he would simply forget. Other accounts (not necessarily reliable, but entertaining all the same) say that before engaging in debate, he would lightly poison himself with a dose of hellebore, a toxic plant, so his mind could be sharper.\nIn Athens, Carneades became a student of the Stoic philosopher Diogenes of Babylon, a pupil of the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus. Carneades was profoundly influenced by the work of Chrysippus and the doctrines of the Stoics, but eventually, he found his philosophical home in the Platonic Academy.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t try this at home: Four types of hellebore (Helleborus species): flowering stems and floral segments. Coloured lithograph. Credit: Wellcome Collection. Public Domain Mark\nThe Sceptical Academy By the time Carneades turned up in Athens, the Academy was under the sway of sceptical doctrines, thanks to the philosopher Arcesilaus. Arcesilaus had become head of the Academy in 266 BCE, several decades before Carneades\u0026rsquo;s birth. And he gave the Platonic tradition a sceptical tinge that it maintained for the next century and a half. Arcesilaus may have been influenced in part by the scepticism of Pyrrho, but his scepticism finds deeper roots in the tradition stemming from Socrates.\nSocrates sought to call into question our claims to knowledge, particularly about ethical issues. For Socrates, even if the goal of truth seems far off, philosophy can nevertheless undermine our ill-founded arguments, and free us from the more egregious forms of error. Arcesilaus took seriously Socrates\u0026rsquo;s attempts to call our knowledge claims into question, but he pushed it further. Socrates claimed to know more than his fellow citizens because he at least knew he knew nothing. Arcesilaus went one step further, saying that he didn\u0026rsquo;t even know that he knew nothing.\nCarneades fell under the sway of the Academy, and the sceptical legacy of Arcesilaus. He didn\u0026rsquo;t write anything, but after the example of Socrates (and Arcesilaus) before him, he conducted his philosophical teaching through dialogue and discussion. And he proved himself to be brilliant in debate. One account claims that \u0026ldquo;Carneades fascinated and enslaved men’s souls … In fact, every opinion of Carneades was victorious, and never any other, since those with whom he was at war were less powerful as speakers.\u0026rdquo; [1]. And it was thanks to this brilliance that he eventually became head of the Academy, sometime around 167 BCE.\nRoman Holiday Around 155 BCE, Carneades received an invitation to lecture in Rome, as an official ambassador sent by Athens. Legend has it that he caused a stir by brilliantly defending arguments about the nature of justice, drawing on Plato and Aristotle. Then, the following day, he astonished (and perhaps enraged) his audience by refuting his arguments from the day before, with equal brilliance.\nIf there is any truth to this story (and it has been contested), the question is this: why would you do such a thing? For Carneades, it was not that justice was unimportant, or something to be mocked by the game of argument and counter-argument. Instead, he wanted to show how fragile and ill-founded all our arguments and judgements are.\nFor Carneades, much of what looked like philosophical argument was in fact dogma. So he sought to show how unfounded this dogma was, and how philosophical arguments often fail to establish what they claim to establish. When applied to something like ethics, this is not to imply that there is no such thing about ethics. It is instead to say that our ethical arguments don\u0026rsquo;t successfully get to the heart of what ethics is all about.\nThe Roman intelligentsia, however, was not universally impressed. The senator and historian Cato the Elder was particularly scandalised. He pressed the Senate to get rid of Carneades by sending him back to Athens, where his dangerous ideas would have less reach and influence.\nSickness, Rage, and Death Back in Athens, Carneades continued his philosophical work and remained head of the Academy for close to two decades. In his seventies, when his health started to fail, he stepped down. He had cataracts, and perhaps his long use of hellebore to improve his mind was catching up with him.\nCarneades is said to have borne the sufferings of old age with something between grumpiness and outright indignant rage. He died in Athens around 129 or 128 BCE.\nOn Truth, Plausibility and the Good Life One of the greatest debates in the philosophical world of which Carneades was a part was the question of the good life. What did it mean to live well?\nThe Epicureans advocated the pursuit of pleasure. The Stoics were committed to finding ways to live in tranquillity, in accord with the nature of things. But for Carneades, these attempts to search for the good life were all fundamentally unfounded. So instead of participating in these debates about the good life, Carneades argued that they were all, in their own way, inconsistent.\nGottlieb Friedrich Riedel (1801), engraving of a bust of Carneades. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nHowever, for Carneades, the problems with philosophy went deeper than these questions about the good life. All these debates about the good life were underpinned by claims about knowledge and truth. And for Carneades, neither the senses nor reason could bring us to truth or certain knowledge. So if philosophers\u0026rsquo; claims about the good life were unfounded, he argued, so too were their claims about how we can come to establish truth and certainty.\nBut if this is the case, then what is left? How are we to live if we give up on searching for the good life? How are we to how to think and reason, if we give up on certainty, on truth? Carneades\u0026rsquo;s critics claimed that his views made life impossible and unliveable (apraxia). But for Carneades, this was no objection at all. Life, despite everything, is liveable. We get by. And how we get by, in the main, is not by fretting over truth, but instead by going with what is plausible (in Greek, to pithanon).\nFor Carneades, there is no direct line between plausibility and truth. But if we forget about worrying over truth, and we think instead about degrees of plausibility, then we are likely to do okay. And this, Carneades recognised, is close to our ordinary approach to truth, when we are not called upon to be philosophers and defend our positions. We go along with the impressions we have because they seem plausible.\nCarneades also argued that because the impressions we have don\u0026rsquo;t exist in a vacuum, but they are part of a larger ecosystem of impressions, some have a greater force than others. Those that fit better with the warp and weft of our other impressions are more plausible than those that do not.\nWriting about Carneades\u0026rsquo;s arguments, the Roman orator Cicero puts it like this: \u0026lsquo;No impression is ever simple in form, but like the links in a chain, one hangs from another.\u0026rsquo; [2] This chain-like hanging-together of our impressions means that there are levels of plausibility. And as a criterion for practical action, plausibility is the best criterion we have.\nThis means that for Carneades, life is liveable after all. To get by in the world, we don\u0026rsquo;t have to shackle ourselves to notions of truth or of the good life. And maybe we are not going to find ourselves living free from error any time soon. But this, anyway, is perhaps a philosopher\u0026rsquo;s pipe-dream. If this is the case, then the best we can hope for is that we might live in a way that works against the dogmatism and arrogance that comes with certainty. [3]\nNotes [1] Praep.

            "content": "Killed by an elephant The philosopher Jaimini is an obscure figure. We know almost nothing about him, other than the story – which may or may not be true – that he was killed by a rampaging elephant. But beyond this, the records are silent.\nAlthough he is known as the founder of the mīmāṃsā philosophical school, we don\u0026rsquo;t even know which century Jaimini lived in. The best guest for a date for the Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra, the foundational text of the mīmāṃsā philosophical tradition attributed to Jaimini, is sometime around 200 BCE, although some scholars date it to a couple of centuries earlier.\nMīmāṃsā philosophy is not particularly well-known outside specialist circles of scholars of Indian philosophy and religion. Nevertheless, it was a long-lived and remarkably broad tradition, spanning around two thousand years. And it is a tradition that still raises intriguing questions about ritual, and about religious language.\nThe sustaining power of ritual The problem the mīmāṃsā philosophers faced was how to account for and justify the practices of ritual as set out in the ancient Vedic texts. The term mīmāṃsā literally means something like “the desire for knowledge”, “inquiry” or “reflection.” And what the philosophers of this tradition were dedicated to reflecting upon or inquiring into were the ritual demands set out in the ancient Vedic texts.\nThe Vedas were traditionally divided into those parts that were concerned with knowledge (the jñāna-kāṇḍa) and those parts that were concerned with ritual action (karma-kāṇḍa). This division reflected a twofold division in the religious and philosophical cultures of India. On the one hand, there was a long tradition of philosophical speculation dating back to the Upaniṣads. On the other hand, there were the texts that set out, in painstaking detail, the practical religious rituals that were considered to order and sustain the universe.\nThe first of these may seem to naturally lend itself more easily to philosophical reflection. But the mīmāṃsā philosophers were committed to thinking through the second set of texts. They wanted to put philosophical flesh on the bones of these religious rituals, making sense of them and justifying them.\nIn the Vedas, ritual is seen as having a sustaining and ordering power. For the ancient Indian brahmins or ritual specialists, the proper performance of ritual was considered to sustain the cosmic ordering of the universe or dharma. The idea that ritual has a sustaining role is one that is not unique to India, but is also found elsewhere, both in Chinese Confucian philosophy and in the philosophical traditions of Mesoamerica. And perhaps this idea is not entirely unfamiliar today. Everyday rituals underpin all social groups, from family units to workplaces to entire nations.\nBut for the ritualists of ancient India, ritual\u0026rsquo;s sustaining power was more than just social. It didn\u0026rsquo;t only uphold and maintain the social fabric, but instead, it was considered to be a means of sustaining the universe as a whole.\nThe challenge of arbitrariness And this is where mīmāṃsā scholars hit a problem. The problem was that of ritual\u0026rsquo;s seemingly wilful weirdness, its curious combination of apparent importance, and apparent arbitrariness. Religious ritual, after all, is often marked by being something other than everyday practice or behaviour. It is performatively strange, set apart from the everyday.\nAnd this performative strangeness means that rituals are always open to the destabilising question of why things are done as they are. Why prostrate full-length before a shrine? Why abstain from meat, or from food altogether, during this particular time-period? Why wear such absurd hats? Why stand solemnly, hands folded, for the national anthem? Why not crouch, or leap in the air joyfully, or wave your arms around, or yodel in tune, or take off all your clothes to demonstrate the naked force of your commitment to the nation? Aren\u0026rsquo;t all the odd forms of ritual behaviour in which human beings indulge somehow arbitrary?\nWhy sing national anthems? Why not yodel? Why not crouch or leap?

Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nSo when you start to ask the question of “why?” things are done as they are, the seeming arbitrariness of ritual becomes a problem. This question “why?” undermines ritual\u0026rsquo;s seriousness, and risks leading us to the conclusion that ritual is just a lot of fuss about nothing.\nAccounting for ritual So, this is one way of understanding the task of Jaimini\u0026rsquo;s Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra: to defend Vedic ritual practice against this charge of arbitrariness, and along the way to demonstrate how this ritual practice can be taken to be authoritative.\nTo do this, the Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra takes an interesting line of argument. It begins by asking what religious language is for. For Jaimini, what is central to the religious language (in the karma-kāṇḍa at least) is that it tells us what to do. Religious texts, for Jaimini, do not function by saying “this is the case.” Nor do they aim to give us information about how things are, bulletins from the divine. Instead, they simply tell us how to act. They tell us what we should and should not do and set out our duties. Religious language, Jaimini argues, is about injunctions (vidhi in Sanskrit).\nBut what makes an injunction? For Jaimini, there\u0026rsquo;s no point in an injunction that tells us to do what we would do anyway. “Have a cup of coffee, put your feet up, and watch TV” would not serve as a religious injunction, because this is something that we might choose to do anyway. There\u0026rsquo;s absolutely no force to an injunction such as this.\nNor do religious injunctions encode teachings that are useful to us for external reasons, or from which we might derive some non-religious benefit. For example, “eat three square meals a day (because it is good for your health)” would not have the force of a religious injunction.\nAnd, finally, Jaimini tells us, religious injunctions cannot enjoin us to do something we simply can\u0026rsquo;t do. “Pray all day until you sprout wings, and then ascend to the heavens like a bird,” is not a good candidate for a religious injunction, because you can pray all you like, but you will remain wingless.\n\u0026ldquo;Sprout wings and fly\u0026rdquo; is a poor candidate for a religious injunction, because such injunctions should be possible. Lithograph, 19th century. Wellcome Collection via Wikimedia Commons.\nThis means that for Jaimini, religious injunctions should be possible. They should be things that we can do (even if they are demanding). But they should also be outside of those things that we might otherwise do for non-religious reasons, even for good moral reasons. In other words, they should be genuinely novel.[2] The oddness of ritual might seem like a bug. But it turns out to be a feature, perhaps the defining feature, of what marks something out as ritual.\nTexts without authors However, this leads Jaimini to a curious place, because this implies that religious injunctions do not have a moral or even a practical force. We perform these things not because they are good or right, but because we are enjoined to perform them. And here, it might look as if Jaimini is doing the opposite of justifying ritual. Having given up on making an appeal to usefulness, or to external moral criteria, as a way of justifying any particular system of religious commands, isn\u0026rsquo;t he instead justifying the arbitrariness of ritual?\nBut Jaimini recognises that this seeming arbitrariness is not the fatal flaw of religious injunctions and rituals. Instead, it is the source of their power. Jaimini follows this line of thought to push towards an astonishingly bold conclusion. He claims that the Vedas are not justified by anything outside themselves. They are absolutely self-sufficient. The Vedas rest on nothing, because everything rests on the Vedas. They are unauthored and eternal, without any need for external justification. For the mīmāṃsā philosophers, one could say, “in the beginning was the text.” And it is because the Vedas do not rest on any external conditions, because they have no justification beyond themselves, then they can be taken as having supreme authority.\nThe power of ritual What is going on here? One way of answering this is by saying that for Jaimini, it is precisely the seeming arbitrariness of religious language – the fact that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t rest on external justifications – that makes it a possible ground of justification. It is as if he is saying, “Sure, religious language detaches itself from all external justifications: but that\u0026rsquo;s the point – that\u0026rsquo;s what makes it religious language.”\nThis raises some intriguing questions about religious language and about the role of ritual in human life. Because even if we don\u0026rsquo;t follow Jaimini to his conclusions about the Vedic texts, perhaps it is possible to see some deeper truths here. For example, the idea that religious injunctions take their power from their strangeness and novelty, their distance from practical concerns. Or the idea that the seeming arbitrariness of religious and ritual injunctions is the key to their strange, compelling power.\nNotes [1] Sue Hamilton\u0026rsquo;s Indian Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2001) gives a nice, clear account of this.\n[2] Shlomo Biderman, \u0026lsquo;Imperatives and Religion in India\u0026rsquo;, in Philosophy of Religion edited Roy W. Perrett, Garland Publishing (2004), pp. 283-294.\nFurther reading One of the best summaries of Jaimini on ritual is in Peter Adamson and Jonardon Ganeri\u0026rsquo;s Classical Indian Philosophy (Oxford University Press 2020).

            "content": "Truth, Reconciliation, and Ubuntu The day after Christmas day last year marked the death of Desmond Mpilo Tutu (1931 - 2021), the Nobel Prizewinner, anti-apartheid activist and former archbishop of Cape Town.\nTutu\u0026rsquo;s life was extraordinary, as is his legacy. Born in 1931 to Tswana and Xhosa parents, he studied theology in London before returning to his native South Africa, where he became a powerful voice in the fight against apartheid.\nWhen I was growing up in the 1980s, Tutu was a familiar figure on the evening news: unstoppable, ebullient, fierce and uncompromising. In 1986, he was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, and after the fall of apartheid, Nelson Mandela appointed him to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In his book No Future Without Forgiveness, Tutu wrote of how the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was an attempt to balance, “justice, accountability, stability, peace, and reconciliation” while attempting to set out a public account of the horrors of the apartheid regime. [1]\nSince Tutu\u0026rsquo;s death, I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking again about his work, and also about its philosophical underpinnings. Because Tutu was responsible for helping to disseminate and popularise a philosophical concept that has since become widespread (and has also lent its name to a popular distribution of the Linux operating system): and that concept, of course, is the concept of ubuntu.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been wanting to write more about African philosophical traditions for a while here on Looking for Wisdom. So, this seems to be a good time to launch into this idea of ubuntu, to ask what it means, and why it matters.\nWhat is Ubuntu? The term ubuntu (and its variants) is found in languages from the Bantu language family. It is made up of two parts: the root ntu, and the prefix ubu. The root means something like “entity” or “object”, while the prefix ubu (or mu) simply means “human.” So the term as a whole suggests the entity that is a human being. As such, it is both descriptive, in that it suggests what human beings are, and it is prescriptive, in that it suggests what human beings should be. Or, to put it in fancier philosophical language, it is both ontological (it talks about the nature of human being), and it is ethical (it talks about what it is for this particular being, human being, to be good).\nScholarly references to the term ubuntu and its equivalents go back to the middle of the twentieth century. And perhaps one of the most famously concise glosses of the term is that from the philosopher John Mbiti. For Mbiti, ubuntu can be captured by the idea “I am because we are, and since we are, therefore, I am.” Mbiti explained the concept like this:\nOnly in terms of other people does the individual become conscious of his own being, his own duties, his privileges and responsibilities towards himself and towards other people. When he suffers, he does not suffer alone but with the corporate group; when he rejoices, he rejoices not alone but with his kinsmen, his neighbors and his relatives whether dead or living. [2]\nTutu\u0026rsquo;s Ubuntu Desmond Tutu, photo in public domain. Via Wikimedia Commons.\nIt is this reading of Ubuntu that became a central peg of Tutu\u0026rsquo;s own philosophy and theology. And while the idea of Ubuntu had deep roots in Bantu language-speaking communities, it was Tutu more than anyone who popularised the term, and gave it a contemporary religious, ethical, philosophical and political urgency. In his short essay, \u0026lsquo;Ubuntu: On the Nature of Human Community\u0026rsquo;, Tutu wrote as follows:\nIN OUR AFRICAN weltanschauung, our worldview, we have something called ubuntu. In Xhosa, we say, “Umntu ngumtu ngabantu.” This expression is very difficult to render in English, but we could translate it by saying, “A person is a person through other persons.” We need other human beings for us to learn how to be human, for none of us comes fully formed into the world. We would not know how to talk, to walk, to think, to eat as human beings unless we learned how to do these things from other human beings. For us, the solitary human being is a contradiction in terms.\nUbuntu is the essence of being human. It speaks of how my humanity is caught up and bound up inextricably with yours. It says, not as Descartes did, “I think, therefore I am” but rather, “I am because I belong.” I need other human beings in order to be human. The completely self-sufficient human being is subhuman. I can be me only if you are fully you. I am because we are, for we are made for togetherness, for family. We are made for complementarity. We are created for a delicate network of relationships, of interdependence with our fellow human beings, with the rest of creation.\nI have gifts that you don’t have, and you have gifts that I don’t have. We are different in order to know our need of each other. To be human is to be dependent. [3]\nRecently, there has been a huge amount of philosophical work on the concept of ubuntu: far more than can be summarised in a short article. But for present purposes, it is worth looking at two aspects of ubuntu: the ontological aspect that asks what it means to be a person, and the ethical aspect that asks how we ought to live in the light of this.\nUbuntu and personhood The first aspect of ubuntu, then, is a claim about the nature of personhood. For those brought up in cultures that are relatively individualistic, it is easy to imagine that we are born as individuals, unique and distinct, and that we gather together into societies to help meet our individual needs: for company, for connection, for security, for material well-being. In this kind of view, individuals come first. They are logically prior to the societies that they form and the social contracts that they make.\nBut the notion of ubuntu turns this on its head, reversing this order of priority. First, there is society. And our uniqueness, individuality, and personhood are all born out of this social connectedness. Taking the perspective of ubuntu, it makes no sense to ask about how individuals come together to form societies. We are, all of us, irreducibly bound up in social connections, webs and networks of material dependence, language, myth, story, and imagination. Even if we retire to the mountains to live as hermits, we are still, at root, irreducibly social beings. And being a hermit is not a refusal of society, but instead simply another way of living in relation to society.\nThis is the ontological claim of ubuntu philosophy. Society is not just an add-on, or an afterthought, or a set of necessary and regrettable compromises. Instead, it is the cradle of our personhood. And this ontological claim seems to me to be plausible–far more plausible, in fact, than the idea that individual personhood comes first. Our being in the world, as the German philosopher Martin Heidegger once put it, is a being-with-others (Mitsein).\nUbuntu and ethics But ubuntu philosophy doesn\u0026rsquo;t just involve ontological claims. It also involves claims about how we ought to be, given that this is who we are. Here\u0026rsquo;s Tutu again,\nIn traditional African society, ubuntu was coveted more than anything else—more than wealth as measured in cattle and the extent of one’s land. Without this quality a prosperous man, even though he might have been a chief, was regarded as someone deserving of pity and even contempt. It was seen as what ultimately distinguished people from animals—the quality of being human and so also humane.\nThose who had ubuntu were compassionate and gentle, they used their strength on behalf of the weak, and they did not take advantage of others—in short, they cared, treating others as what they were: human beings. If you lacked ubuntu, in a sense you lacked an indispensable ingredient of being human. [4]\nFor Tutu, if we are indeed interdependent to the very root of our being, this means that we have irreducible obligations to others. But in meeting these irreducible obligations, it is not a question of the trade-off between self-interest and other-interest.\nIf we conceptualise society as a group of individuals entering a social contract, then to be in society always involves trading in some of our self-interest for the benefits that society may bring. In this view, society always involves a balance of competing interests.\nBut the idea of ubuntu holds a more radical possibility: the possibility of finding a way of living in society that augments the interests of everyone. This is an idea that goes beyond an ethics of consensus or accommodation, to an idea of mutual flourishing and uplift. And in this way, it offers a challenge to find new and creative forms of political organisation that might serve this mutual flourishing.\nTutu\u0026rsquo;s own work is a testimony to this. Later, writing about restorative justice and about the horrors of the testimonies gathered by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he claimed that, “Ubuntu (and so restorative justice) gives up on no one. No one is a totally hopeless and irredeemable case.” Because ultimately, to give up on anyone is to give up on interdependence, and it is to give up on the possibility of community.\nAnd if is something perhaps utopian in this, Tutu\u0026rsquo;s own example reminds us that it is not an easy or naive utopianism. It is, instead, a robust and tough-minded kind of hope. a determination to find better ways of flourishing as the determinedly, irreducibly social beings that we are.\nNotes Desmond Mpilo Tutu, No Future Without Forgiveness (Doubleday 1999).

In this course, we explored everything from the colonial and contemporary Chin history, to the legends of Chin origins, in a time when the stones were soft.\nIn the beginning, when the stones were soft, all mankind spoke the same language, and there was no war on earth. But just before the darkness called Chun-mui came to the earth, God gave different languages to different peoples and instructed them to write on something else. While the Chin ancestors carefully inscribed their language on leather, the Burman ancestors, who were very lazy, wrote their language on stone, which was soft. However, soon after they had made the inscription of their languages, the ‘darkness’ came and the Sun disappeared from the earth. During the ‘darkness’ the stone became hard but the leather got wet. Before the Sun came back to the earth, and while the wet leather was still very smelly, a hungry dog ate up the leather, and in this way, the Chin ancestors lost their written language.\nDrawing on anthroplogy, history, political science and archaeology, we asked what it means to be Chin today, and how it might be possible to imagine and reimagine Chin futures.\n",

            "content": "Introduction Andy West is Philosopher in Residence at HMP Pentonville, and the author of the frankly brilliant The Life Inside: A Memoir of Prison, Family and Philosophy, which is due out from Picador in February 2022.\nQ: One of the reasons I’m interested in doing these interviews is I want to get a sense of what it means to do philosophy. So my first question is this: how did you get into philosophy? And what drives you as a philosopher?\nWhen I was a kid and my brother was inside, it was painful to experience how flattening the narratives were around people in prison. I think experiencing stigma so intimately installed this fundamental sense that things are always more complex than they appear. I think that might have been my first taste of the philosophical instinct. I think it’s still the main thing that drives me today: the idea that the more space we make for complexity, the less space there will be for shame.\nQ: Your book, *The Life Inside*, is incredibly rich. It is part memoir, part account of teaching in prisons, and part meditation on freedom, confinement, prison, guilt, contingency, and philosophy itself. If you could pin down the book’s central philosophical, or even existential, preoccupation, what would it be?\nShame. Books written by political prisoners like Edith Eger and Ahmet Altan tend to focus more on oppression, resistance, and surviving confinement. But I think there’s a different flavour to books like A Crowbar in the Buddhist Garden, by Stephen Reid or Redeemable, by Erwin James. Those men were convicted for serious crimes. Although they engage with the structural problem of prisons, they write to confront shame and to figure out if it’s a teacher or a tyrant. These are the writers I feel closer to.\nA year into writing The Life Inside, I realised I was writing about the inherited shame and survivor shame of having family inside. For the next twelve months, I used the book to try to answer the big questions about shame: What is it? How does it feel? How does it shape a life? How do people let go of it? How do people live in spite of it?\nQ: Your book is underpinned by a profound ambivalence about prisons and regimes of confinement. You write at one point about needing to find a way to continue to work in prison, while simultaneously wanting to tear it down. Has your work as a philosopher in prisons allowed you to find a way through this ambivalence? Or has it only deepened it?\nI can’t tell if my ambivalence is a strength or a weakness.\nOn the one hand, it’s important to me because prison is so dehumanising; ambivalence is my way of staying open to the humanity in people. It’s a readiness to see that a person is more complex than their rap sheet or prison number. I also include in my ambivalence those people and that part of us that wants punishment and revenge. Not because I see those things as necessary or justified, but because they seem to come from a very human instinct too.\nOn the other hand, I sometimes wonder if my ambivalence towards prisons comes from the learned hopelessness I experienced from losing my brother so many times to prison. Perhaps that drilled into me the belief that I won’t be able to change things. So instead of seeking liberation through radical politics, I look for what freedom I can find in accepting that ‘It is what it is.’\nI haven’t come to a conclusion on that yet, which, yes, I know is a very ambivalent thing to say.\nQ: Moving away from personal, existential questions, what value do you think there is in teaching philosophy in prison? Can it help? And what does it even mean to say that it can help?\nA better philosopher would answer that question with a systematic argument, but I’ll answer it with an anecdote. There’s a prison officer I work with who drops into my classes just to listen. Afterwards, he often says to me, ‘It’s just so interesting the things they say.’ It has expanded his sense of the people he is locking up every night. In prison, you’re a number before you’re a name. People aren’t ‘moved’ they’re ‘shipped out’. ‘Dinner’ is called ‘feeding time’, as if people on the wing are cattle. It’s not a place where subjecthood is recognised or nurtured. One of the most counter-cultural things you can do in that setting is have a philosophical conversation.\nQ: Philosophers (and writers more generally) are often tempted to turn prison into a metaphor or a symbol. But one of the virtues of your book is how it pushes back against this impulse, paying attention instead to the realities of prison life. To what extent do you think our tendency to turn prison into a metaphor or a symbol gets in the way of us thinking about actual prisons, and the societies of which they are a part? And how can we think better about these institutions and these societies?\nIn the public imagination, the prison wall operates as a dividing line between ‘good people’ and ‘bad people’. The fact that most people only see the inside of a prison at the cinema makes this symbol all the more potent. People often ask me if I’ve ever been attacked in prison or if physical fights ever break out in my classroom. ‘No’, I laugh. ‘Why would that happen?’ People ask that question because the prison wall allows us to maintain the conceit that violence, darkness and chaos are within those walls rather than within us. So yes, I wanted to describe the concrete particulars of life inside with as much attention as I could as a way to cut through the mythos of prison.\nAt the same time, as a writer, I don’t want to trade in the richness of symbol and metaphor for dreary social realism. The wall is such a powerful image. In the book, I tell the story of my relationship with my uncle around the idea of a wall that’s between us and how I might ‘get in’. As writers, we can get trapped in negative metaphors, but we also have the power to develop and expand those metaphors too.\nQ: One of the recurring preoccupations in the book is masculinity. In some places, you address this directly. But it is also there as a preoccupation that runs throughout the entire book. Were you conscious of this as a driving concern?\nFrom the beginning, I knew in a superficial sense that the book was about masculinity because I was writing about my dad, brother and uncle and because I was writing about prison and 95% of prisoners are men. I later understood in a profound sense that the book was about masculinity when I found myself writing so much about shame.\nPride and shame constitute so much of masculinity and that helps to explain why men commit crime at a much higher rate than women. That’s not that I don’t think women have their own difficult experience of shame, but I think they don’t respond to it as violently or harmfully as men do.\nQ: Your book, commendably, doesn’t seek easy solutions. After finishing it, I was more convinced than ever not only that prisons are deeply weird places, but that the everyday notions of crime, punishment, guilt and so on that underpin them are also equally weird. I’m not asking you for a comprehensive plan for prison reform, or for a whole new theory of justice. But how do you think the harms of the present system could be ameliorated? How can things be made better?\nAlmost everything about prisons needs to be radically changed. But I find it hard to get invested in perfecting the fine points of my vision for a better system when I see how little political will there is for prisons and prisoners.\nI don’t have it in me to deliberate over whether I’m a reformist or an abolitionist, knowing that prisoners are at the bottom of most people’s priorities. What I’d rather do is try to allow more people to know about what goes on in prisons and get them thinking about it. That needs to happen if we are going to build any political will.\nIn the early 1900s, Brixton Prison was constructing a gallows to hold executions, but when the affluent locals found out they protested. They put together a petition in The Shoreditch Observer that said the gallows “may not be so favourably regarded by a suburb so famous for its middle-class respectability as Brixton.” Brixton prison stopped building the gallows. No executions ever took place there.\nPart of the reason I stuck to a show-don’t-tell style of writing in The Life Inside was because I wanted the middle-class reader to see what goes on inside. Whilst they may not be the group most affected by prison, they are the group that you need to connect with if you want to get any change through parliament.\nQ: And now, a question about teaching philosophy from a position outside the demands and cultures of the academic world. Do you think the tendency to see philosophy as a purely academic practice limits its value? Or, to put it more bluntly, is philosophy wasted on the academy?\nA lot of academic philosophy I studied in my degree didn’t appeal to me because it took such a top-down approach to questions. We were told to start by defining our concepts and working outwards from those axioms. It was a very brain-on-a-stick mode of enquiry. For the last six or seven years, I’ve been experimenting with a more bottom-up approach. My brother had been to prison twelve times. I had never been away. That’s what made me need to ask, ‘What does my moral luck mean for who I am? How do I relate to others who’ve been confronted with situations that I haven’t?’ That was not a disembodied enquiry.\nI sometimes wonder if I’ll ever go and study philosophy academically again. I know the academy has evolved a lot in the last decade since I finished my BA. It has more space for situated arguments, embodiment and standpoint epistemologies like feminism and critical race theory. Who knows, I might go back, but for now, I want to keep enjoying the freedom of writing on my own terms.\nQ: Okay. So looking to the future, what’s next on the horizon for you and your work? Both as a writer, and also as somebody who teaches philosophy?\nThe classroom is still one of the most thrilling places in the world for me, so I want to keep teaching philosophy in prisons. The book is being translated into some really fascinating countries that have their own particular relationship with prison like Turkey, China, Korea and Taiwan. I can’t wait to talk with those readers about what they think of the themes of the book like prisons, masculinity, kindness, hope, shame, home, freedom etc. I think those conversations might be what shapes my next writing project.\nQ: Finally, if you could give any advice to an aspiring philosopher, what would it be?\nDon’t waste your time talking with philosophers who treat philosophy like a parlour game.\nBrief bio Andy West is the author of The Life Inside: A Memoir of Prison, Family and Philosophy.

            "content": "Taking pleasure seriously The Greek philosopher Epicurus is a philosopher most often associated with hedonism, the idea that the good life is a life where we should seek to maximise our pleasure. This might conjure up images of wild excess, or endless drug-fuelled orgies. And this, in fact, is how Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s opponents sometimes represented his philosophy and his community of followers. But Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s own approach to living pleasurably was more sedate than his critics imagined.\nAbove all else, Epicurus believed we don\u0026rsquo;t take pleasure seriously enough. For all our commitment to pleasure, he argued, we are remarkably bad at it. So the way to live better is to get smarter about pleasure.\nThe philosopher from Samos Epicurus was born on the island of Samos in 341 BCE. He studied extensively, drawing on many of the traditions of philosophy in the ancient Greek world. He was taught by Pamphilus, who was a philosopher in the tradition stemming from Plato, and later by Nausiphanes, who was a follower of the atomist philosopher Democritus. He was also influenced by the philosopher Pyrrho, who argued that the goal of the philosophical life was not truth or wisdom, but instead ataraxia, or freedom from disturbance. Epicurus also took on board the ideas of the Cyrenaic philosophers, who argued for the centrality of pleasure to the good life. For many years, Epicurus was an itinerant teacher of philosophy. But in the year 307 BCE, he moved to Athens, and there he settled.\nPhilosophy in the garden Epicurus bought a place outside the city limits of Athens, calling it \u0026ldquo;the Garden\u0026rdquo; (κῆπος / kipos in Greek). And there he started to teach.\nEpicurus\u0026rsquo;s Garden is sometimes talked about as a philosophical “school”. But this is liable to give us the wrong impression. Instead of imagining the Garden as something like a schoolroom, we\u0026rsquo;d be better off imagining it as a kind of religious community, or a commune. It was a residential community where the followers of Epicurus lived together, as they discussed and practised their teacher\u0026rsquo;s doctrines.\nLike many such communities throughout history, Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s garden was, from the very beginning, a socially disruptive experiment. He accepted both women and slaves into his community as equals, something that scandalised his contemporaries. And he advocated a withdrawal from the demands of public life.\nLiving slightly apart from the hurly-burly of Athenian city life, the community in the Garden was dedicated to the pursuit and exploration of pleasure. According to the later Stoic philosopher Seneca, there was a sign over the gate that read:\nHERE, GUEST, WILL YOU BE WELL ENTERTAINED: HERE PLEASURE IS THE HIGHEST GOOD. [1]\nBut this community of pleasure was surprisingly austere: instead of being lavished with fine things, visitors to the Garden would be more likely to be met with a glass of water, some simple loaves or biscuits, and a hunk of cheese. Because, Epicurus argued, this kind of simple fare is all you need for true luxury.\nEpicurus spent the rest of his life in the Garden, teaching, writing voluminously, and cultivating pleasure. He put a high value on friendship and on community. He died in 270 BCE, after going through the agonising pain of kidney stones. But contemporary accounts say he remained cheerful, capable of enjoying the pleasures of life, until the very end.\nTaking pleasure seriously This may not sound like a life dedicated to pleasure. But to understand what is going on here, you need to understand Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s distinctive analysis of what pleasure is.\nEpicurus recognised that we care about pleasure. We like it. And this is entirely reasonable, because pleasure is the only thing that we can claim is, in and of itself, good. This means that all pleasure is good in itself. But some pleasures bring with them unfortunate pains, complications and side effects.\nThe trouble with pleasure, for Epicurus, is not pleasure itself. There is nothing better than pleasure, after all. It is that in our pursuit of pleasure, we often end up with its opposite. Our relentless search for pleasure has all kinds of unfortunate, destabilising side effects. It unbalances us and throws us off course.\nEpicurus believed that the end-goal of philosophy was freedom from turbulence or disturbance. Image: Naruto Whirlpools by Hiroshige (1855). Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThink of the downward spiral of the film star on a drink and drugs binge. It\u0026rsquo;s not that there isn\u0026rsquo;t pleasure in bingeing. It is only that this is a pleasure that leads to a lot of pain somewhere down the line. The problem with our film star\u0026rsquo;s binge is not that an excess of pleasure damages us. It is that ultimately they have failed to think clearly about how to cultivate pleasure. They think they are making life more pleasurable, but instead, they are making it less so. In his Principal Doctrines, recorded by Diogenes Laërtius, Epicurus writes,\nNo pleasure is a bad thing in itself. But the things which produce certain pleasures bring troubles many times greater than the pleasures. [2]\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that pleasure is the only good thing in the world. Virtue, for example, is good. So too is friendship. But in the last analysis, according to Epicurus, all these things are good because they support a life of pleasure.\nFor Epicurus, the state of maximum pleasure is a state of ataraxia – this idea of “freedom from disturbance” that he took from Pyrrho and his followers. In all our choices, he argues, we should do what gives us freedom from bodily pain, and freedom from mental disturbance or turbulence. If we can overcome physical pain and mental turbulence, then we can attain to the most pleasurable life possible.\nA pleasurable life is a life of equanimity, a life where we avoid all disturbance.\nIf this is the goal, then the trick is to get smart about pleasure, so we can enjoy a pleasurable, equanimous life, without any of the side effects that come from ill-advised pursuit of destabilising pleasures.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a passage from Epicurus\u0026rsquo;s Letter to Menoeceus:\nSo when we say that pleasure is the goal we do not mean the pleasures of the profligate or the pleasures of consumption, as some believe, either from ignorance and disagreement or from deliberate misinterpretation, but rather the lack of pain in the body and disturbance in the soul. For it is not drinking bouts and continuous partying and enjoying boys and women, or consuming fish and the other dainties of an extravagant table, which produce the pleasant life, but sober calculation which searches out the reasons for every choice and avoidance\u0026hellip; [3]\nA small measure of cheese Cheese, by Folris Van Dyck, 1613. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nSo to get more of a handle on pleasure, Epicurus claims, we need to look at our desires more closely. We need to sift through our desires, and think about the potential side effects of the things that we think we want. Epicurus writes:\nOf desires, some are natural and necessary, some natural and not necessary, and some neither natural nor necessary but occurring as a result of a groundless opinion. [4]\nThere are two distinctions here: between what is natural and unnatural; and between what is necessary and unnecessary. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at them in turn.\nFirst, the distinction between natural and unnatural desires. Natural desires are those desires that are rooted in our physical needs, and that can be satisfied. An example is the desire for food. We eat, and we are full. End of story.\nUnnatural desires, on the other hand, are desires that cannot be satisfied, and that have no direct connection to our immediate physical needs. They are things we can never get enough of, things like honour, status, and wealth. We get a bit of honour, and we want more; we get some measure of status, and we want more; we come by a little wealth, and we want more. For Epicurus, unnatural desires are always destabilising. We are never going to be content if we set our heart on wealth, fame, and honour.\nBut here, there\u0026rsquo;s a further distinction to be made. Our natural desires can be either necessary or unnecessary.\nThink about what happens if you are hungry. This is a natural desire. It is necessary that you have some sort of food. And so for Epicurus, the desire for some sort of food is natural and necessary. However, now imagine that you are fixated on having a tasty slice of apple pie as a way of sating your hunger. Your desire for a tasty slice of apple pie is natural, but it is unnecessary. After all, any food would do.\nThis doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t go for it if an apple pie is to hand. But fixating on the apple pie as the only way to sate your hunger is destabilising: you end up scouring town for pie-shops, raging at the injustice when you find the shops are closed, and generally making your life less pleasurable.\nFor Epicurus, the more we can focus on our natural desires, and the more we can focus on what is only necessary, the more we can attain to a life of ataraxia, and live a life of supreme pleasure. And there is perhaps no better expression of this than the famous line from Epicurus, when he asks a friend to send him a small gift, so his desires might be met.\nSend me a small measure of cheese, so that when I want to have a feast I shall be able to do so.

            "content": "The puzzle of gift-giving It\u0026rsquo;s the time of year when, for those of us who live in countries and communities where Christmas is celebrated, we face the prospect of an explosion of gift exchange. This gift-giving raises all kinds of practical issues (as we asked in the last philosopher file, what do you get a man like Uncle Pedro?). But it is also philosophically puzzling. Why do we do it? What\u0026rsquo;s going on in this frenzy of giving and receiving gifts?\nLast time, we looked at what could be called the paradox of gift-giving. On the one hand, gift-giving has the appearance of free exchange; but on the other hand, it is bound up with all kinds of obligations. Our philosophical excursion into the world of gift-giving in the previous Philosopher File left us in an uncomfortable place. Because according to the philosopher Jacques Derrida, for there to be a gift at all, it would be necessary this escape the economy of gift and counter-gift, this whole notion of exchange. A true gift is a gift where you get nothing back because when you get something back, you are no longer talking about a gift, you are talking about exchanging one thing for another. But where in the world can you find a gift such as this, a gift free of mutual obligation, free of any counter-gift, free of calculations about exchange?\nThe argument seems a compelling one. It is also unsettling because if you follow it through, it looks as if everything is on the brink of collapsing (or as if it has already collapsed) into the logic of economic reason. And it forces us to ask if there is any space for something apart from self-interest.\nSo in this week\u0026rsquo;s philosopher file, we are going to get more practical about gifts, so we can find a way out of this impasse. Because if you look more closely, it is not clear that Derrida\u0026rsquo;s account really matches how gifts work; and his notion of the gift doesn\u0026rsquo;t really map on to how we experience gift-giving. For Derrida, the only true gift would be the gift that left no trace, that effaced or erased itself, so undercutting the logic of exchange. But arguably, such a gift is no gift at all.\nWhy is this the case? Think of it like this. If you give me a gift, I not only want to get something out of it myself (it\u0026rsquo;s nice to be given gifts), but I want you to get something out of it (it\u0026rsquo;s nice to give). As the recipient of a gift, I want there to be some counter-gift, even if it is only knowing that you have a warm glow when you give something to me. I want this not because I am relentlessly thinking about economic circles and balancing the books (even if I may have an eye on this): I want it because it seems, in the moment of gift-giving, that we are both getting more than we started with. In the giving (or exchange) of gifts, our mutual aim is to both feel like we are coming out of the transaction with a sense that life has been somehow augmented by this exchange. As a recipient, this means I want you to get something out of it, even if it is only the pleasure of giving. This mutuality is central to gift-giving.\nBreaking the symmetry of gift and counter-gift The great anthropologist and theorist Marcel Mauss, in his Essai sur le don, or “Essay on the Gift”, talked about how our concerns with generosity often mask a strict accounting system of gift and counter-gift. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s undeniably true that in gift-giving we do keep an eye on these things. But we do so not because our ultimate aim in gift-giving is to ensure strict symmetry. Instead, we do it because a rough-and-ready appropriateness of gift and counter-gift keeps the machinery of gift-giving running. So we keep our eye on these things much in the same way we might keep our eye on the functioning of a car engine. We don\u0026rsquo;t want the engine to break down. But we are not running it for its own sake. We are running it to take us somewhere. A well-functioning engine is not our aim. It is not our destination. But keeping an eye on how the machinery works helps us get to this aim or destination, whatever it may be.\nIt is the same with the engine of gift-giving. You want it to take you somewhere, so it makes sense to keep your eye on how the machine is running. And one part of this is keeping your eye on the appropriateness of gift and counter-gift. But, despite everything Mauss says, here you don\u0026rsquo;t want exact symmetry: this is the worst thing possible if what you care about is keeping the machine running.\nBoth experience and anthropological data back up the importance of asymmetry in gift exchange. The anthropologist Roy Wagner\u0026rsquo;s fieldwork among Daribi-speaking peoples in Papua New Guinea gives us a good example of this. Among these communities, Wagner writes, the last thing you want to do in gift-giving is to have symmetry. Symmetry, or a concern with symmetrical exactness, kills off the dynamism and the pleasure that underpins gift exchange in the first place [1]. Asymmetry, as long it isn\u0026rsquo;t too severe, is the thing that keeps gift exchange ticking over, that lends the system its life and its energy.\nSo what do we look for in gift exchange, if not for symmetry? Here we can find one answer in the indigenous philosophies of Indonesia. In her brilliant ethnography of the Tanimbar Islands in Southeast Maluku, the anthropologist Susan McKinnon writes about the complex cycles of gift exchange that once crisscrossed the islands. At first glance, these exchanges may seem like the kind of exchanges that Mauss talked about, bound by rigorous mutual obligations. And to some extent, they were, at least to the extent that accepting some mutual obligation is necessary to keep the machine (or the game) running. But the game of gift-giving in Tanimbar was played not for the sake of symmetry or of profit, but for the sake of something beyond the game itself: the new possibilities, relationships, and pleasures the game opens up. As McKinnon\u0026rsquo;s Tanimbarese hosts told her, the purpose of gift-giving was not to “look for profit,” but instead to “look for relation.” [2]\nIn this looking for relation, what is optimal is not cold, hard accounting. It is a sense that we are both winners in an exchange: a sense that there is a surplus benefit, beyond our economic reasoning, that makes things better for both parties.\nChristmas gifts: Illustration from a book of art by students of Franz Čižek. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nMcKinnon\u0026rsquo;s Tanimbarese friends told her that the hallmark of a good gift in Tanimbar is that it should be manminak, a word in the Fordatan language that means “tasty,” “sweet” or “good.” A non-tasty, non-sweet, non-good gift, or one that we do not experience as tasty, sweet and good, is something that we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t experience as a gift.\nAnd this also means that any gift that effaces itself (as Derrida\u0026rsquo;s impossible/possible gift does), that leaves no trace, that won\u0026rsquo;t get its hands dirty with economic cycles, is no gift at all. As we have already seen, if you give me a gift, I want you to get something back, even if it is only the pleasure of giving. But this doesn\u0026rsquo;t leave us fully within the sphere of economic reason. Because as we make exchanges and counter-exchanges, looking for relation if our gifts are well-made, all parties benefit from the tastiness, the sweetness, the goodness of this giving.\nGift-giving, at best, is not about economic circles. It is about spirals where, with every single cycle, things get better for us all.\nGifts as creative works Derrida\u0026rsquo;s work may throw into perspective some of our anxieties around gift-giving. And this is no doubt useful. But the metaphor of closed circles of exchange simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t do a very good job of describing what it is like to engage in gift exchange. And the spiral-like view of gift-giving sketched out above seems to me to be closer to the actual experience we have of gifts if they are well-given and well-received. Beyond symmetry, looking for relation rather than profit, we exchange gifts to make life tastier, sweeter, better.\nIn the picture that is beginning to emerge here, rather than seeing a gulf between pure economic reason on the one hand, and the pure gift that leaves no trace on the other, gift-giving seems something more messy and tangled. It is compromised but not fatally so. It is bound up with economic anxiety, but also with mutually-enhancing pleasure. And it is also something inherently creative. As I put it in my book Hello, Stranger: How We Find Connection in a Disconnected World, the writer Lewis Hyde has argued that creative works are gifts. But the reverse is also true gifts are creative works. They create trust between strangers. They create new possibilities and new futures.\nWeighing up gift-giving Once we put to one side for a moment our anxieties about the inescapability of economic reason, this opens the way to asking about what makes a good gift. And here, the philosophical traditions of India can help.\nFor many Indian philosophical traditions, the question of dāna, or giving, is of central importance. But these traditions sidestep the anxiety found in Derrida\u0026rsquo;s work. There\u0026rsquo;s a robust acceptance of the idea that a gift is a gift, leaving us with the question of how we can make sure that gifts are well-made.\nAccording to the Jain text, the Tattvārtha Sūtra, dating to between the 2nd and 5th century CE, the worth of a gift is to be judged by the “excellence in the donor, the recipient, the procedure, and the substance.” This means there are four considerations when weighing up the worth of a gift:\nWho is giving To whom they are giving How they are giving What is being given Jain art, Lustration of the Infant Jina Mahavira, Folio from a Kalpasutra Manuscript. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThere are similar lists in other traditions as well. The Buddhists, for example, often list three criteria for judging the worth of the gift: the state of mind of the donor, the gift given, and the recipient. And these three criteria map, more or less, onto the first, second, and fourth from the Jain list. But the Jain list is nice because the question of how a gift is given encompasses not only the state of mind of the donor but also ticklish questions of timeliness, social context, ritual and appropriateness, all of which seem to be centrally important to most human gift-giving.\nAs Mariah Heim points out in her book about theories of gift-giving in South Asia, in all of these South Asian traditions, the concern with dāna or giving “does not theorize the gift as a site for self-interested individuals to make (and mask) exchanges.” [3] But neither does it see one-way, unreciprocated gifts as entirely selfless and pure. Instead, it sees the act of giving as something that “makes possible valued human relationships based on esteem and admiration.”\nAnd as a way of thinking through good gifts and bad gifts, if we can shake off our Derridean anxieties for a moment, the Jain approach gives us a good starting point. These are all questions worth asking: Who am I to give this gift? To whom do I want to give it? How should I best give it? And what should I give?\nAnd if you get these questions right, then life becomes — as the theorists of the Tanimbar islands might put it — tastier, and more worth living.\nNotes: [1] ‘“Luck in double focus”: ritualised hospitality in Melanesia’, Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (2012)\n[2] Susan McKinnon, From a Shattered Sun: Hierarchy, Gender and Alliance in the Tanimbar Islands (University of Wisconsin Press 1991).\n[3] Maria Heim, Theories of the Gift in South Asia: Hindu, Buddhist and Jain Reflections on Dāna (Routledge 2004), p. 144.\nFurther Reading: You might like to read my piece on failed gift-giving in the Tanimbar Islands over on Aeon Magazine.\n",

            "content": "So, in those countries where Christmas is celebrated, it\u0026rsquo;s getting to that time of year when the eternal philosophical problem presents itself: *what should I get as a gift for Uncle Pedro?\nLast year\u0026rsquo;s socks didn\u0026rsquo;t go down well: he didn\u0026rsquo;t wear them even once. Then there was the debacle with the chocolate (how had you never known that Uncle Pedro was allergic to cocoa beans)? As for the six-volume boxed set of Proust that you bought him, he hasn\u0026rsquo;t even cracked the spine on the first volume.\nBut the more you think about the perennial problem that is Uncle Pedro, the more the philosophical questions multiply. What is this curious thing that you feel compelled to do every year at around this time? Why this frenzy of buying and giving things that nobody seems to need? What is the point? Is it generosity or compulsion? Why that sense of overwhelming obligation, that knowledge that you can\u0026rsquo;t not buy Uncle Pedro something, even if you\u0026rsquo;re pretty sure he\u0026rsquo;s going to hate whatever it is you buy.\nThe mighty Mauss If you have ever been perplexed by questions like these, particularly around this time of year, you could do worse than turn to the work of Marcel Mauss. In 1925, the philosopher and sociologist published his Essai sur le don, or “Essay on the Gift.” The essay drew on a huge range of sources, including ethnographic data from Polynesia and the Pacific Northwest of America, and ancient German and Roman law, to explore the universal human institution of gift exchange.\nThis breadth of sources was typical of Mauss. He was a prodigiously gifted writer. He learned Māori and Sanskrit. He was famous as a storyteller, and was a teacher with considerable charisma. And his intellectual interests were seemingly omnivorous: he studied everything from anthropology, to the nature of prayer, to magic, to the ethnography of the Inuit peoples.\nBut it is his essay on the gift for which he remains most famous today. Mauss\u0026rsquo;s essay explores the complexity and hidden dynamics of human gift-giving. And at the centre of Mauss\u0026rsquo;s argument is the idea that in gift-giving, there is a disjunction between what seems to be going on, and what is actually going on, between appearance and reality.\nGift-giving is something that is apparently enacted out of pure generosity. We give gifts as if we are acting freely (this may recall the earlier Looking for Wisdom piece on the subjunctive, or “as if” nature of ritual…). But in reality, what is going on in gift-giving is a “strict accounting system” that involves an “intricate mingling of symmetrical and contrary rights and duties.” [1]\nThink about what happens when Christmas comes around, and you start thinking as usual about Uncle Pedro. You rack your brains to think of an appropriate gift. After all, you have to get him something. But what?\nFor Mauss, this sense of obligation — this “have to” — is central to all gift-giving. It it not just an obligation to give. It is also an obligation to receive (if Uncle Pedro rejected your gift, refusing to play the game of giving and receiving, you would find him blameable — and, to be honest, you are still sore about the multi-volume Proust set). And it is also the obligation to reciprocate (which means that you can take some scant comfort from the fact that Uncle Pedro is having exactly the same difficulties, because the rules of the game are that he has to give you something in return).\nWhat does this add up to? For Mauss, this constant cycle of gift-giving, this symmetry of obligations, of gifts and counter-gifts, is a way of balancing social accounts, while also maintaining and reaffirming social relationships. We give gifts to cement social solidarity, but all the time we are watching our backs to make sure we are not being taken for mugs, and that Uncle Pedro is not getting away with stinginess.\nMedieval Gift-giving. 1300s. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe economics of giving Mauss\u0026rsquo;s view of the gift has become central to anthropological understandings of what is going on when we exchange gifts. But it raises a problem. Where does this leave the actual urge to generosity?\nBefore Mauss, it might have been possible to distinguish between the unfree compulsion of market economies, and the freedom of gift-giving. But Mauss seems to suggest that there is nothing that escapes the logic of mutual accounting. So where does this leave the impulse to pure generosity, or giving for its own sake, free of any expectation of return?\nThis puzzle is one that the philosopher Jacques Derrida takes up in his book Given Time: 1. Counterfeit Money.\nThe problem, as Derrida puts it, is that the moment we are aware of something as a gift, we are entering into a system of mutual accounting. A real gift, a true gift, would break with this circle of reciprocity, symmetry and mutual exchange. A true gift is one that doesn\u0026rsquo;t circulate, that is not exchanged for anything else.\nSo the question is this: is there anything, anywhere, that breaks with economic reason in this way? Derrida puts the question like this:\nIf there is a gift, the given of the gift (that which one gives, that which is given, the gift is given thing or as act of donation) must not come back to the giving. It must not circulate, it must not be exchanged, it must not in any case be exhausted, as a gift, by the process of exchange by the movement of circulation of the circle in the form or return to the point of departure. [2]\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say that I take in a foster cat because I am kind-hearted. Although it may seem like an act of generosity, this kind-heartedness is not disinterested, because I also get a cat to snuggle on cold winter evenings. My apparent generosity is also a kind of exchange: shelter for snuggles.\nLooking for Wisdom foster cat/intern, Baby Sarah.

As it is a sunny day, and I\u0026rsquo;m in a good mood, I give them a ten-dollar bill. They thank me. We have a pleasant exchange, and both go on our way, a spring in our strides.\nFor the rest of the morning, I feel good about myself. And no wonder: from my apparent gift, all kinds of good things flow back to me — this good feeling, this sense of my own moral worth, this pleasure of connection with another person. So, if you were inclined to burst my bubble, you might be tempted to ask: isn\u0026rsquo;t this just a more elaborate kind of economy or exchange? And if it is, then can it really be said to be a gift at all?\nAnd this is why Derrida comments drily that Mauss\u0026rsquo;s essay — with its meticulous exploration of exchange, economy and mutual obligation — talks about everything but the gift. Because surely a gift is something other than exchange and economic reason.\nImpossible gifts So where does this leave the idea of the gift? Well, as usual with Derrida, it\u0026rsquo;s complicated. Because any acknowledgement of a gift, on the part of either the giver or the recipient, necessarily sucks us back into the circle of economic exchange. Whatever we get in return — whether we receive material goods, social goods or even spiritual goods — we are still in the realm of exchange. We are still dealing with some kind of economy. And this annuls the gift-nature of the gift.\nFor there to be a true gift, Derrida argues, the gift would have to not appear as a gift, either to the giver or to the recipient. Or if it appeared, it would have to be immediately effaced and forgotten. Because every time we acknowledge something as a gift, we find ourselves falling back into a cycle of exchange. This is why Derrida says, in his usual teasing way:\nThese conditions of possibility of the gift (that some \u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo; gives some \u0026ldquo;thing\u0026rdquo; to some \u0026ldquo;one other\u0026rdquo;) designate simultaneously the conditions of the impossibility of the gift. [3]\nNow, all this is the kind of thing that makes certain kinds of philosophers grumble and mutter, “What are you talking about, Jacques?” And to make sense of it, you have to get on board with the spirit of what Derrida is up to. On the one hand, he wants to appeal to our hunches that there are gifts, that economics isn\u0026rsquo;t everything, that there is something that escapes the economic order. But on the other hand, he wants to show how hard it is to articulate what it might mean to escape this economic order.\nFor Derrida\u0026rsquo;s opponents, this may look very much like a vacuous intellectual game, mere playing with words. But seeing it like this does Derrida a disservice. The real force of what Derrida is saying is ethical. He is pushing against the complacency with which we come to the judgement, “Yes, this is good, this is ethical, this is generous.” Derrida wants to trouble our ethical complacency, opening up a space for unease and uncertainty. He is not cynically giving up on the idea of the gift altogether, and reducing everything down to self-interest. Instead, he is trying to provoke us to maintain a genuinely ethical vigilance, in the middle of all our calculations and judgements. It is as if he is saying: let us go on giving, aware of the complexity this involves, refusing to rest easy in the image of our own goodness, but open to the possibility (however impossible) of a generosity beyond the reach of economic reasoning.\nNext time, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at perspectives from elsewhere that take a different view on gift-giving: from the religious traditions of South Asia and indigenous cultures in Southeast Asia. We\u0026rsquo;re going to ask whether we need to follow Derrida to this tangled, difficult conclusion. And we will be thinking not in terms of economic circles, but instead of spirals.

            "content": "The philosopher who couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold his drink Chrysippus was born sometime around 279 BCE in the town of Soli, now on the southern coast of Turkey. Diogenes Laërtius says that Chrysippus first trained as a long-distance runner, but eventually, he came to Athens and became fascinated by Stoicism. He became a follower of Cleanthes (c. 330 — c. 230 BC), himself a disciple of Zeno of Citium, and when Cleanthes died, Chrysippus took over as head of the Stoic school.\nReports from the ancient world tend to agree that Chrysippus was remarkably skilled as a philosopher, and his reputation endured as an exceptionally able thinker. There may be a germ of truth in Diogenes\u0026rsquo;s story about Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s earlier life in long-distance running. Because if Chrysippus had anything, it was stamina, discipline and self-control.\nChrysippus was a prolific writer. Diogenes Laërtius says that he set himself the discipline of writing five hundred lines a day. As a result, Diogenes tells us, his body of work was enormous, extending to more than 700 books. More cautious commentators than Diogenes suggest that Chrysippus wrote only around 200 works – still a huge output. Nevertheless, some snarkier voices in the ancient world argued that this prodigious productivity wasn\u0026rsquo;t as impressive as it seems at first glance. Much of Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s output, they said, was made up of either repetition or of passages copied out from other authors. But there is no way of telling: most of what Chrysippus wrote is lost.\nUnsurprisingly, given his substantial workload, Chrysippus was something of a hermit. He taught, lectured and wrote extensively. But he liked his own company and that of his family, preferring to avoid the social life of Athens. In one story, he was invited to hear Aristo, another philosopher, give a lecture. Chrysippus refused the invitation. His friends tried to persuade him, saying that everybody was going to be there. In response, Chrysippus said, “If I had followed the crowd, I should not have studied philosophy.” [1]\nSometimes, Chrysippus was persuaded to break with his quiet life and attend parties. But by all accounts, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t much fun. Diogenes said that at parties, Chrysippus usually sat in the corner quietly, and after drinking he was unsteady on his legs.\nAs for Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s death, there are varying accounts. Some say that he collapsed while drunk, unable to hold his drink, and after five days more or less comatose, he passed away. Other accounts of his death are stranger still. In these accounts, Chrysippus met an old woman with a donkey. The donkey, apparently, was munching on figs, which the philosopher found hilarious. “Why don\u0026rsquo;t you give the donkey some wine to wash down the figs?” Chrysippus told the old woman. Then he burst into vigorous laughter. And this, they say, is how he died: laughing at his own feeble joke.\nIt is likely that these accounts of Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s death are untrue. Chrysippus was a philosopher renowned for his austerity and his self-control. So putting about the rumour that he met his end by losing the run of himself, in the intoxication of wine or of laughter, may be a dig at both Chrysippus himself, and at his philosopy of self-control.\nOn Marmite, and why emotions are really judgements Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s contributions to Stoic philosophy were extensive. He developed all three of the Stoic pillars of philosophy: logic, physics and ethics. And many scholars see him as responsible for putting Stoicism on a firm footing, ensuring its longevity in Greece and, later, in Rome.\nOne of Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s most famous works in the ancient world was On Affections (Περί παθών in Greek), which sets out his vision of human emotion. Although we know more about this than many others of Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s works, the work survives only in fragmentary fashion. Most of what remains comes from the physician Galen, who lived in the 2nd Century BCE, and who was an opponent of the Stoic view.\nChrysippus\u0026rsquo;s On Affections was not just a distanced philosophical treatise. Instead, he intended to cure us of the problems that human emotions cause. So after setting out a theory of the emotions, the final section of the work was dedicated to providing a therapeutic approach to the problems caused by our emotions or our affections.\nWhat emotions are Chrysippus\u0026rsquo;s argument begins with the claim that pathos (πάθος), which is usually translated as “emotion”, “affection” or “passion” involves a particular kind of judgement. This might seem curious to us. We might think that emotions just happen to us. But Chrysippus insists that emotions are also something that we do.\nOn the one hand, our emotions are passive (the word “passive” has the same root as “passion” and pathos), in that they involve being affected by a certain stimulus; but on the other hand, they are active, in that they involve two distinct judgements. The first is a judgement about whether this stimulus is good and bad. And the second is a judgement about what an appropriate reaction is to this stimulus. The crucial thing about this second judgement is that it induces movement: in other words, it leads to a particular response.\nSo, for example, if you feed me Marmite (please don\u0026rsquo;t), the passive aspect is the taste of the Marmite on my tongue. But the active aspect is made up of two judgements. The first is my judging that Marmite is bad and unpleasant (it is). And the second is my judging that it is proper to respond to this badness by recoiling, or by loudly protesting that the person who has given me this to eat is a scoundrel.\nMarmite Advertisement from the Woman\u0026rsquo;s Weekly, 1953. Public domain via Internet Archive.\nPhilosophy as Therapy For Chrysippus, emotion is an affliction of the soul, much in the same way that sickness or fever are afflictions of the body. And one of the most important jobs of philosophy is analogous to that of medicine: to cure these afflictions of the soul. This was not an idea unique to Chrysippus. Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, and many others talked about philosophy using medical metaphors. But Chrysippus really took the idea of philosophy as therapy to heart.\nEmotions seem to take us over, seemingly not under the control of reason, impelling us to act in this or that way, often to the detriment of ourselves and others. So for Chrysippus, a proper philosophical understanding of emotion is the first step towards a life well-lived. Because once we see that emotions are a form of judgement, we can start to bring them under our control. Once we master our judgements, then we can begin to wrestle our unruly emotions into some kind of order .\nNotes [1] J. B.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Ritual is a Creative Act This is the second in a two-part series on ritual. In the first piece, we looked at how ritual helps us get by, sometimes almost magically, in a complicated social world (you can read part one of this series here).\nBut ritual is more than just a way of getting by. It is also a way of giving shape to ourselves and our shared world. To engage in ritual is to engage in a creative act that can transform the world. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how!\nShaping Ourselves One philosopher who was keenly aware of the creative power of ritual was the Confucian philosopher Xunzi. Xunzi is famous in particular for his claim that human nature is bad (arguing against the more sunny-natured Mencius, who insisted that human nature was good).\nIn his Discourse on Ritual, Xunzi says that we are born with desires that we hunger to satisfy. But desires are unlimited: when we get what we want, we just want more. And more. And more. When left unchecked, this desire for more leads to social discord, to disharmony, and to general impoverishment. The world, alas, simply isn\u0026rsquo;t built for us to fulfil all of our desires to the greatest possible extent.\nThis is why ritual matters for Xunzi. It helps shape ourselves and manage our desires. It imposes a degree of order or measure on our otherwise insatiable wanting.\nIt is worth paying attention to what Xunzi is not saying here. He is not claiming that we should somehow eradicate desire, or that desire in itself is bad. Desire is simply a part of what makes us human. What we need to do is not to expunge all our desires, but instead to nurture them in the right ways. The word for “nurture” here is yang (養), which originally meant “to herd sheep” or “to tend to flocks.” So you could see ritual as a way of herding our desires and our dispositions, so they don\u0026rsquo;t cause havoc or run riot.\nIn an earlier Philosopher File, we saw that for Xunzi, human beings are by their very nature crooked. Human badness is the consequence of desire having no natural terminus. This being the case, we can\u0026rsquo;t rely on nature to solve our problems. We have to invent artificial means of managing ourselves.\nAnd this is where ritual comes in. Ritual shapes us. It regulates and manages our desires. Through the proper use of ritual, Xunzi claims, we can find a concordance between our desires and the material conditions of the world. And if we can manage our desires so that the material things of the world are not depleted or exhausted, then we can live as desiring creatures, without the world falling into chaos.\nImagine, for example, that we are down to the last biscuit on the plate. If we are both hungry, and let our desires have free rein, then we will naturally fall into conflict. But more often than not, we don\u0026rsquo;t do that. Instead of snatching the biscuit and cramming it into our mouths, and thereby starting a small biscuit war, we resort to ritual. We get polite. We say, “No, please, take it, I\u0026rsquo;ve had enough…” And through the coolness of ritual, we manage the heat of our desires.\nAlphonse Marie Mucha, Biscuits Lefèvre-Utile*, 1896 via* Wikimedia Commons.\nFor Xunzi, ritual lends our lives a good measure, putting the brakes on excess and insufficiency. Ritual, he writes, “cuts off what is too long and extends what is too short. It subtracts from what is excessive and adds to what is insufficient.” [1] It is a way of making sure that we maintain an appropriate measure when it comes to the things that make up our life: material things, our moods, our states of mind, even our cultural practices.\nAnd for Xunzi, this is hugely powerful because through ritual we can shape our inherent natures to such an extent that we can approach sage-like human perfection.\nThus, I say that human nature is the original beginning and the raw material, and deliberate effort is what makes it patterned, ordered, and exalted. If there were no human nature, then there would be nothing for deliberate effort to be applied to. If there were no deliberate effort, then human nature would not be able to beautify itself. Human nature and deliberate effort must unite, and then the reputation of the sage and the work of unifying all under Heaven are thereupon brought to completion.[2]\nShaping the World But ritual isn\u0026rsquo;t just about completing or shaping ourselves. Because, as Xunzi also suggests, through ritual we complete or shape the world itself.\nIn the world, all members of the myriad things and the human race must await the sage, and only then will they be appropriately divided up. [3]\nFor Xunzi, ritual allows us to give order to the myriad things of the world (wanwu 萬物). The world in its raw, natural state is incomplete. It is the artificiality of ritual, while being rooted in the patterns of the world, that brings these patterns to completion.\nThis idea of ritual as something that allows us to creatively participate in the ongoing completion of the world, is also found in other philosophical traditions. In his fascinating comparative study of Maya and Chinese philosophy, the philosopher Alexus McLeod draws parallels between Xunzi\u0026rsquo;s arguments about the creative power of ritual, and those of the philosophers of the Maya world.\nMcLeod argues that for the Maya philosophers, ritual is makes us co-creators of the world. Within Maya culture, one of the biggest ritual preoccupations is with the “keeping of days.” The Daykeeper or K’iche’ is responsible for keeping track of the 260-day Maya calendar. The Daykeeper reads the patterns inherent in the world, conducts divination, and decides on the appropriate rituals and their appropriate timing. In doing so, they not only shape the social world, but also the natural order.\nHumans play a role in the continual creation of things through their daykeeping and other rituals, but these rituals are not completely conventional, arbitrarily set by humans. Keeping the days properly and performing rituals properly is a matter of understanding the patterns inherent in the world. [4]\nCreativity and ritual For the Maya philosophers, as for the Confucians, ritual is a means of participation in the ongoing creation of the world. Ritual allows us to attune ourselves to the world\u0026rsquo;s patterns, and to augment them. If our rituals are well-regulated and rooted in an attentiveness to the pre-existing world, they allow us to give order and shape to our lives and to the world we share.\nWhat this means is that in both these traditions, ritual is seen as something inherently creative. We can easily think of rituals as being about doggedly repeating the same old patterns, over and over again, as if we were on autopilot. Seen like this, ritual seems to be the opposite of creativity. But if the Confucians and the philosophers of the Maya world are right, then they challenge this view, forcing us to ask: what if the reverse turned out to be the case? What if the task of transforming the world, making it anew, cannot be accomplished without the artfulness and the artificiality of ritual?\nNotes Eric L.

            "content": "Looking at the overlooked Sometimes, the most philosophically interesting things in human life are those things that are so close to us, we overlook their importance. So in the next couple of pieces here in Looking for Wisdom, I\u0026rsquo;m going to explore one of these philosophically interesting, but often hidden, topics: and that topic is ritual.\nWhen we hear the word “ritual”, what often comes to mind is something pretty elaborate, involving fancy outfits, the recitation of obscure texts, long robes, even longer faces, and altars fragrant with incense. And ritual may be all of these things. But it may also be something much more ordinary, something that pervades our lives in all kinds of subtle ways we often overlook, and something that for all its everydayness is also curiously magical.\nA simple cup of tea Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example. Imagine you are passing by my home, and you decide to knock on the door. It\u0026rsquo;s been a while since we\u0026rsquo;ve seen each other, so you fancy calling in. Maybe, you think, I\u0026rsquo;m not busy. Maybe we can spend a pleasant half-hour chatting about philosophy. So you knock on the door (rat-a-tat-tat), and wait for a few seconds.\nI open the door and say hello. We exchange greetings. Perhaps we shake hands if you are a shaking-hands kind of friend. Perhaps we hug if our relationship is close enough for that. “Come in,” I say.\n“You\u0026rsquo;re not busy?”\n“No,” I lie. This is not true. I have a looming deadline, but I prefer not to be unwelcoming. “I\u0026rsquo;m writing an article about ritual and stuff,” I say. “But it can wait.” I smile reassuringly.\n“Okay,” you reply. You step into the hallway and close the door behind you. I take your coat, hang it on a peg, then head off into the kitchen. You follow me down the hall. “Tea?” I ask, over my shoulder.\n“Ooh,” you say (let\u0026rsquo;s imagine we are both British: when offered tea in Britain, before accepting, it is normal to say “Ooh” like this. We\u0026rsquo;re a strange people). “That would be great.”\nWe go into the kitchen and I turn on the kettle…\nA plate from Rudyard Kipling\u0026rsquo;s With the Night Mail by Frank Xavier Leyendecker. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe texture of everyday life What\u0026rsquo;s going on here? It seems quite ordinary, but when you look more closely, it is also hugely complex. Think about how you knocked on the door. That friendly “rat-a-tat-tat” signals to me that you are a friendly visitor. If you were a bailiff, for example, or a would-be murderer pursuing their victim, you would perhaps signal your less friendly intentions with a more robust “knock knock knock.” Your well-chosen knock suggests a jaunty confidence, but also a reassuring friendliness-in-advance.\nWhat happens next? We greet each other, using more or less set phrases and gestures. There\u0026rsquo;s nothing inevitable about these greetings: they are culturally determined. And the success of our greeting depends on us both knowing the rules and how to apply them. Occasionally, we misjudge: you may move in for a hug, while I put my hand out for a handshake, and may I end up poking you in the stomach. But most of the time, we manage pretty well.\nThen you ask me a question: “You\u0026rsquo;re not busy?” Once again, this is a kind of ritual. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to know, factually, if I am busy or not. You want to be reassured that your visit is okay. So what do I do? I lie. I have no other choice. I may be fiendishly busy. But to say, “To be frank, I am: please leave” would be unnecessarily harsh. So I lie.\nNext, because I am British, I offer you a cup of tea. Not because you are thirsty, of course. But because this is what you do to welcome guests. And in response, you emit that strange “ooh” sound, and then you accept. Again, this is not necessarily because you are thirsty. Maybe you have just had a cup of tea before turning up, and don\u0026rsquo;t want any more. Maybe what you really want is a stiff whiskey. But you accept anyway, to make me feel good. So we go into the kitchen, I turn on the kettle, and we take it from there.\nThe moral (in)significance of ritual What, you might be wondering, does this have to do with philosophy?\nAt first glance, not very much. After all, surely these forms of etiquette are simply culturally contingent. Surely, they don\u0026rsquo;t have any great moral weight, when compared to proper grown-up moral issues like virtue, justice and so on. As the philosopher Amy Olberding points out, these kinds of shared rules and understandings,\nare notoriously fallible, imperfect, and indeed perhaps sometimes arbitrary, so to treat them as binding and authoritative hardly seems moral, much less a course likely to produce truly virtuous people. [1]\nDoes ritual really have anything to do with ethics? Or is it just fluff? Are all these culturally determined rules morally significant? According to the Chinese philosopher Confucius (551-479 BCE), they are not only morally significant, but getting the hang of ritual is one of the most morally significant things.\nStraightening your mat (or your tie) Confucius was famously a stickler for ritual. The term in Chinese is li (禮), which can also be translated as “etiquette” or “manners.” The Chinese character is pictographic, representing an ancestral tablet and a ceremonial vessel. And Confucius was certainly concerned with elaborate rites involving ancestral tablets and ceremonial vessels; but for him, the scope of ritual was much broader than this.\nAccording to the Analects, Confucius was someone who would not sit down without first straightening out his mat. When he attended feasts with the elderly, he waited for them to depart, and only then did he himself leave. He did not talk while in bed, and avoided lecturing others while eating. If given an abundance of food, he ate in moderation, without any excess. He was meticulous about his personal appearance, paying close attention to how he dressed, and its impact upon others. And when travelling far from home, relying on the hospitality of others, he always made sure that he turned up at the threshold of his hosts with an appropriate gift.\nAll of this might lead us to the conclusion that Confucius was more than a little uptight: not only over-fastidious in his habits, but also convinced that other people should be as well. But this is to do him a disservice. For Confucius, all of this extreme attention to the minutiae of everyday life was not simply about personal style. It was a powerful means of bringing about social harmony and social efficacy–in other words, achieving your moral goals, whatever these may be. As his disciple, Master You explains in the Analects,\nMaster You said, “When it comes to the practice of ritual, it is harmonious ease (he 和) that is to be valued. It is precisely such harmony that makes the Way of the Former Kings so beautiful. If you merely stick rigidly to ritual in all matters, great and small, there will remain that which you cannot accomplish. Yet if you know enough to value harmonious ease but try to attain it without being regulated by the rites, this will not work either. [2]\nWhy straighten your mat or your tie? Why think hard about what gift to bring your hosts? Why take care to defer to elderly guests? Why knock on the door in a particular way? Why offer tea to your guests? Because these things lead to social harmony, and they allow us to accomplish what we need to accomplish. Taken together, these minutiae make up a large part of the art of living alongside our fellow human beings, and we ignore them at our peril.\nThe musicality of ritual However, if you care about the efficacy of ritual, you need to strike a fine balance. You need to understand the patterns and conventions, however strange they may be; but you also need to be flexible, if the situation demands. Rigidity gets you nowhere. But the same is true of foregoing a concern with ritual altogether. A ritual well-conducted may follow all kinds of mutual, tacit rules. But it also needs to be supple, and responsive to the specific situation in which we find ourselves.\nThis is made clear in another passage in the Analects (3.15), where we see Confucius going into the Great Ancestral Temple in the state of Lu, a religious building dedicated to the former Duke of Zhou. Like any diligent student, as the rituals in the temple unfold, Confucius keeps asking about what is going on, insatiable in his desire to know. A bystander complains that this is a sure sign of Confucius\u0026rsquo;s lack of understanding of ritual. But Confucius replies that his curiosity is itself a part of ritual. Because if you care about ritual, you have to leave room for a little slack, for improvisation, and for learning.\nOne way of seeing this combination of structure and flexibility is using an analogy of music. And in fact, for Confucius, music and ritual were very closely allied. “A person who is not Good—what have they to do with ritual?” Confucius asks at one point. “A person who is not Good—what have they to do with music?” [3] You could see ritual as something that regulates the mutual music of our shared lives. Like music, ritual aims to harmonise, and it does so by following regular patterns. But also, like music, it is supple, open to the possibility of improvisation and creativity.\nOr perhaps, even better than music, we could see ritual as a kind of dance that we perform with each other. Through ritual, we seek out each other\u0026rsquo;s rhythm, and as we do so, we deepen our understanding of each other.\nDancers at an Evening concert. India, Mughal period, circa 1650-70. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe magic of acting “as if” But what is going on when we engage in the strange dance of ritual? Because if ritual is omnipresent in human life, it is also quite strange. Why do we offer tea to our non-thirsty guests, or straighten our mats when a wonky mat would suffice, or shake hands, or do any of this stuff?\nOne answer is that when engaging in ritual, we are acting “as if” (or to put it in a more fancy way, we are acting subjunctively). When we offer tea to our guest, even though they\u0026rsquo;ve just had a cup, we are acting as if they are thirsty. We are performing concern for them. When we say we are not busy to a visitor turning up on the threshold, we are acting as if we are not busy, as if we have room for this other person in our life. And when we attend a wedding, the ritual words and gestures unfold as if this is the finest match between two human individuals in all recorded history, even if we know that it probably isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThis understanding of the subjunctive (or “as if”) nature of ritual goes all the way back to Confucius. In the Analects, Confucius suggests that we should offer sacrifices to the ancestors as if (*ru/*如 in Chinese) their spirits were present. Confucius is not making a commitment to saying whether the spirits of the ancestors do or don\u0026rsquo;t exist. He is only saying that we should act as if they do.\nBut why should we do this? Why does acting as if matter in human life? One answer is that when we act as if something is the case, we increase the likelihood that it will become the case. Or we increase the likelihood that the things we might hope for were it the case might eventually come to pass. Acting as if allows us to accomplish things that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t accomplish if we simply relied on what actually was the case.\nThis is why the philosopher Herbert Fingarette, in his book The Secular as Sacred, claims that ritual has an almost magical function. Fingarette writes,\nBy “magic” I mean the power of a specific person to accomplish his will directly and effortless through ritual, gesture and incantation. The user of magic \u0026hellip; simply wills the end in the proper ritual setting and with the proper ritual gesture and word; without further effort on his part, the deed is accomplished. [4]\nIn acting as if we are in harmony, or acting as if we are pleased to see our guest, or acting as if the happy couple are indeed made for each other, we go several steps towards bringing these as if situations into being. We magic the hoped-for world into existence. And we accomplish what we want to accomplish.\nThe limits of sincerity But there\u0026rsquo;s also a problem here. After is, isn\u0026rsquo;t there something a bit unseemly, a bit insincere, about all this acting as if? Where does it leave our commitment to truth? Perhaps this is why some philosophers have had difficulty recognising the role of ritual in human life. In its seeming insincerity (or at least its non-sincerity), it seems to risk our philosophical commitment to truth.\nOne book that explores this tension between ritual and sincerity is the brilliant Ritual and Its Consequences: An Essay on the Limits of Sincerity, by Adam Seligman, Robert Weller, Michael Puett and Bennett Simon. The authors argue that we are always caught between the these two poles. Do we tell our friend that their outfit looks terrible (sincerity), or smile sweetly and tell them they look gorgeous (ritual)? And whatever our commitments might be, we probably can\u0026rsquo;t exist at either pole of this tension for long. We can never be wholly committed to ritual at the cost of sincerity; and we can never be wholly sincere, and turn our back on ritual.\nA life of pure ritual or pure sincerity would be absurd. Both modes of thought coexist in all of us, though not without tension. From the point of view of sincerity, ritual is mere hypocrisy and convention. Viewed from ritual, however, sincerity can threaten the very existence of society by refusing its conventions. [5]\nIf we turn our back on ritual, even for the best moral reasons, we turn our back on the ways that ritual can bring about positive moral change. And we give up on one of the primary means that we have for bringing about the kind of society we want to live in.\nSeligman and his colleagues write that “ritual encompasses the ambiguity of life much better than sincerity can.”[6] In doing so, in allowing us to encompass and navigate ambiguity, it can help shape ourselves, our social relationships, and the world of which we are a part.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s a whole other story. So stay tuned for the next philosopher file on ritual, where we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at the creative power of ritual to give shape to ourselves and our world, drawing on philosophers from Ancient China to Mesoamerica!\nNotes [1] Amy Olberding, “Etiquette: A Confucian Contribution to Moral Philosophy”, Ethics Vol. 126, No. 2 (January 2016), pp. 422-446\n[2] Edward Slingerland (translator), Confucius: Analects (Hackett 2003), 1.12\n[3] Analects 3.3.\n[4] Herbert Fingarette, Confucius: The Secular as Sacred (Waveland 1972), p. 3\n[5] Adam Seligman et al., Ritual and its Consequences: An Essay on the Limits of Sincerity (Oxford University Press 2008). p. 104\n[6] ibid. p. 113\nFurther Reading Books I can\u0026rsquo;t recommend Seligman and co.\u0026rsquo;s book enough: Adam Seligman et al., Ritual and its Consequences: An Essay on the Limits of Sincerity (Oxford University Press 2008)\nHerbert Fingarette\u0026rsquo;s Confucius: The Secular as Sacred is old (which dates from 1972), but very good.\nI talk a lot about ritual in my new book, Hello, Stranger: How We Find Connection in a Disconnected World (Granta 2021).

            "content": "Cultural connections The philosopher Pyrrho (c. 360 — c. 270 BCE) was born in Elis in Western Greece. Much of what we know about him is hearsay, deriving from the somewhat breathless accounts of his student and all-round biggest philosophical fan, Timon of Phlius. Timon\u0026rsquo;s stories, whether true or not, were later taken up by the biographer Diogenes Laërtius. Diogenes supplemented Timon\u0026rsquo;s admiring accounts with some intriguing tales about Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s eccentricities taken from the writer Antigonus of Carystus.\nAccording to these unreliable accounts, Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s family trade was the art of divination; but Pyrrho himself started life as a painter, not entirely successfully. He took to philosophy after coming across the atomist ideas of Democritus. The person responsible for this was probably Anaxarchus, a some-time student of Democritus\u0026rsquo; with whom Pyrrho travelled to India. Between 327 and 325 BCE, the two of them set off on a road-trip with Alexander the Great\u0026rsquo;s army as far as Northwest India, or modern-day Pakistan.\nWith the naked philosophers The accounts suggest that Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s road-trip was both personally and philosophically transformative. In Northwest India, Pyrrho met with some philosophers whom the Greeks called gymnosophists — literally “naked wise men.” And Pyrrho was impressed by their austere, philosophical mode of living.\nThe gymnosophists were less impressed, however. One account suggests that they told Anaxarchus and Pyrrho they would never attain to wisdom if they fawned before kings such as Alexander. Pyrrho took this to heart, and decided to change his life.\nPyrrho returned home to Elis, where he took up a life of poverty and simplicity. He cultivated an indifference to worldly things. Diogenes Laërtius tells us how Pyrrho happily participated in housework, something unthinkable for a man of his station and class.\nThis apparent indifference to status was paradoxically fruitful. The traveller Pausanias says that the people of Elis erected a statue in Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s honour. Other accounts say that he was made a high priest, in recognition of his piety.\nPhilosophy The problem with ethics One of the best sources on early Pyrrhonism is an account written several hundred years after Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s death, in the 1st century BCE, by the philosopher Aristocles. According to Aristocles, Timon (and thus Pyrrho) said that happiness rests upon the answers we give to three different questions:\nwhoever wants to be happy should consider these three questions. First, how things [pragmata, or \u0026ldquo;ethical questions\u0026rdquo;] are by their nature; second, in what way we should be disposed towards these things, and lastly, what will happen to those so disposed. [1]\nThe question here is one of how we should dispose ourselves towards ethical questions. How should we think about ethics? How should we proceed when facing these questions?\nPyrrho says these kinds of ethical questions (questions like, “Is it right to eat meat?”, “Should philosophers be naked at all times?”, “What is goodness?” and so on), are characterised by three things. They are indifferentiable. They are unmeasurable. And they are undecidable.\n[Pyrrho] declared that things are equally indifferentiable and unmeasurable and undecidable (adiaphora kai astathmêta kai anepikrita); because of this neither our perceptions nor opinions tell the truth or lie. [2]\nAnd this is a problem. Because when we make ethical claims, we are doing so on the assumption that precisely the opposite is true. We assume we know what we are talking about, or that we can ultimately establish the truth of what we are claiming. But we don\u0026rsquo;t and we can\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe undecidability of ethical questions goes back to Socrates and his dissatisfaction with the ethical hunches of his contemporaries. But Socrates always told his fellow philosophers to keep on looking for agreement.\nPyrrho took another angle. Ethical questions for Pyrrho are in principle impossible to differentiate (adiaphora). They are in principle not questions about anything measurable (astathmēta). And they are in principle things that cannot be decided upon (adiaphora).\nDisentangling ourselves from ethics Notice all those negations! Pyrrho is far more interested in telling us what cannot be done than he is in telling us what can be done.\nBut Pyrrho is also raising an important issue. Think of the heat and fury that is generated by discussions about ethics. It is hard to think of anything besides ethics — questions of right and wrong, justice and injustice — that generates such heat and fury. And if these things are so hard to decide upon, this puts us in a perilous position (something Socrates also knew). We can\u0026rsquo;t decide on these questions; but these are the very questions where our inability to decide leads to difficulty and conflict. So how should we dispose ourselves towards these pragmata? What attitude should we adopt when faced by this undecidability?\nThere are two possible responses to this. One is, like Socrates, to continue looking for an answer to these questions, to try to disentangle them. The other is to give up on seeking out answers altogether. If ethical questions are a tangle, then it may be that we can\u0026rsquo;t disentangle them or sort them out. But at least we can disentangle ourselves from these questions. This means that for Pyrrho, instead of trying harder to get to the bottom of things (as Socrates advised), the best solution is to simply step away.\nwe must be without opinions, and lean to neither side, and remain unwavering (adoxastous kai aklineis kai akradantous) [3]\nAgain, Pyrrho bombards us with negations. We must be without opinions. We must be without inclinations. And we must be without any kind of wavering. If this is a kind of ethics, it is a kind of ethics expressed entirely in the negative.\nA strange freedom As for where this all gets us, once again, Pyrrho talks in negatives. “What remains for those who have this attitude,” he says, “is first unspeakingness (aphasia), and then undisturbedness (ataraxia).”\nThe first of these, aphasia, is a little obscure. What is unspeakingness? Some scholars claim it is the unwillingness to commit oneself verbally to any specific position. But others claim that for Pyrrho, it means literally silence. Why silence? Perhaps because once you have done away with all of this ethical chatter, there is really nothing much to say.\nThe other idea of ataraxia — undisturbedness, or freedom from disturbance — is one that become important to later Greek philosophy as a goal for life, in particular in the work of the Epicurean philosophers. Because once you step outside of debates around what is good and what is not, you are left with a profound tranquillity: something that early account of Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s own character attest to.\nWas Pyrrho a sceptic? For some, Pyrrho stands at the origins of the Greek and Roman philosophical school of scepticism. But although the later sceptics traced their roots back to his thinking, Pyrrho himself seems less concerned with knowledge-claims than later sceptics. Instead, he seems more concerned with pursuing a mode of existence in which he cultivated a form of disengagement and disentanglement. It\u0026rsquo;s only with later writers such as Sextus Empiricus (who flourished around 200 CE, half a millennium after Pyrrho) that scepticism as we know it takes on its full form. But we\u0026rsquo;ll get to the later sceptics in a later Philosopher File. So stay tuned!\nNotes: [1] Quoted in Svavar Hrafn Svavarsson, “Pyrrho and early Pyrrhonism”, The Cambridge Companion to Scepticism (Cambridge University Press), p. 41\n[2] ibid.\n[3] ibid.\nFurther Reading Books Christopher Beckwith\u0026rsquo;s Greek Buddha: Pyrrho’s Encounter with Early Buddhism in Central Asia makes strong claims about the influence of Buddhism on Pyrrho\u0026rsquo;s thinking.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Living the Cynic Life Somewhere between a philosopher, a comedian, and an activist, Hipparchia of Maroneia was one of the most significant early philosophers in the Cynic school founded by Diogenes. She was born some time around 350 BCE in the Thracian village of Maroneia, but when she was still young, she moved with her family to Athens. Her background was privileged and wealthy. However, along with her brother Metrocles, once in Athens, she became involved with the Cynic philosophers.\nThe Cynics were a school who scorned the values of their peers, and Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s philosophical embrace of Cynicism led to her turning her back on her life of privilege, taking up a more challenging and controversial lifestyle.\nDog-coupling Against her parents wishes, Hipparchia married Crates, the hunch-backed student of Diogenes (and first philosophy teacher of Zeno of Citium). By the time of their marriage, Crates was already old. The story in Diogenes Laërtius is that Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s parents wanted to prevent the marriage. Crates himself agreed to try to put her off by stripping off to stand naked in front of her, saying:\nHere is your husband\u0026hellip; and here is all he owns. So consider carefully, because you cannot be my partner unless you are prepared to adopt my ways. [1]\nHipparchia, contrary to her parents\u0026rsquo; hopes, liked what she saw, so she and Crates married. From that point on, they took up the Cynic lifestyle, much of the time living rough, their only possessions the Cynic robe, satchel, and staff. In one later account, Hipparchia claims,\nInstead of the role of a fashionably dressed woman, I, Hipparchia, chose the Cynics’ uniquely demanding way of life. I don’t care for shawls secured with clasps, high-heeled leather shoes, or fancy fillets to hold my hair in place. Supplied with barley meal, supported by my staff, with my doubled cloak that serves for dress by day, at night as bedding on the rocky ground\u0026hellip; [2]\nLater accounts also claim Crates and Hipparchia often had sex in public, something Crates referred to as kynogamia: dog-coupling, or simply dogging. Some commentators have claimed this is an invention of later critics, seeking to bring the Cynics into disrepute; but it is consistent with the teaching of Crates\u0026rsquo; own teacher Diogenes, who had a fondness for public masturbation, and with the Cynic determination to live in accord with nature, even if it caused public scandal.\nThe double act Marriage was one of the social conventions rejected by the Cynics; so the Cynic-inspired marriage of Crates and Hipparchia was controversial not only among the opponents of the Cynics, but also within Cynic circles. However, Crates and Hipparchia became a regular double-act in Athens, and their unconventional lifestyle allowed them to challenge many of the social assumptions of their time. They messed with ideas about men\u0026rsquo;s and women\u0026rsquo;s social roles; and they also used the relative freedom from restraint brought by their unconventional lifestyle to act as philosophical counsellors to their fellow citizens.\nHipparchia is said to have written several Cynic works, including Philosophical Subjects, and Explorations and Questions for Theodorus the Atheist; but none of these works have survived. She and Crates also raised two children, a boy and a girl, in the Cynic lifestyle.\nHipparchia died sometime in the first half of the 3rd century BCE, although we know nothing about the manner of her death.\nOn Shamelessness and Comedy Shamelessness We don\u0026rsquo;t have any complete contemporary accounts of Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s life. However, the stories about her often associate her with the Cynic idea of anaideia, or “shamelessness.”\nFor the Cynics, shamelessness was something to be deliberately practised as a way of challenging the moral norms of society. Shame was an impediment to the main goal of the Cynic life: living in accord with nature. But this shamelessness was not a rejection of ethics. For the Cynics, shame or aidōs is a problem precisely because it masquerades as ethics, but isn\u0026rsquo;t.\nTo be shameless is not to be unethical, even if it might be judged so by one\u0026rsquo;s peers; it is instead to break with the cultural norms that regulate not only individual bodies and lives, but also whole societies.\nPhilosophy as comedy In one famous story, Hipparchia and Crates turn up at a symposium. This is already a scandal because, in Ancient Greece, drinking parties are usually attended only by men. One of the other guests, Theodorus, protests at her presence. And Hipparchia responds with what in Greek was known as a spoudogeloion. The word spoudogeloion combines both the word spoudaion, or “serious”, and geloion, or “comic”. So a spoudogeloion is a comic argument that serves nevertheless to push home a serious point.\nHipparchia\u0026rsquo;s opens by arguing that if something is permissible for Theodorus, it is also permissible for Hipparchia. If men can attend symposia, she argues, why not women? There\u0026rsquo;s a wider point here as well. For the Cynics, questions of good and bad must be universally true, rather than applying only to women or to men, or to members of a particular culture or social class.\nBut then things get interesting as Hipparchia makes a comic turn. It is not wrong, she says, for Theodorus to punch himself. At this point in the story, you have to imagine them arguing in context: with Hipparchia playing the crowd at a boisterous drinking party. And if it is not wrong for Theodorus to punch himself, Hipparchia argues, and if what is permissible for Theodorus is also permissible for Hipparchia, she concludes that it is not wrong for her to punch him.\nLike many jokes, perhaps you had to be there. But you can imagine the roars of laughter as Theodorus is put in his place. It is not entirely clear from the story whether Hipparchia follows through and punches the annoying Theodorus. But it seems likely because in the debacle that follows, Theodorus tries to strip her of her Cynic robe.\nRenouncing the loom For Theodorus, removing Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s robe serves a double function: first, it removes the source of her authority because the Cynic robe identifies her as a philosopher; second, it attempts to shame her into silence. However, Theodorus has woefully misread the situation. Hipparchia, after all, is a Cynic. She has embraced shamelessness; and she has given up on social notions of shame and honour, knowing that these notions have little to do with ethics. So, the story says, Hipparchia simply shrugs off her nakedness, showing “no signs of a woman\u0026rsquo;s alarm or timidity.”\nTheodorus then resorts to gender stereotypes, pouring scorn on Hipparchia for leaving her loom, traditionally the domain of women. Unsurprisingly, Hipparchia is unimpressed. “Don’t suppose for a moment,” she says acidly, “that I regret the time I spend improving my mind instead of squatting by a loom.” [3]\nHere lies the genius of Hipparchia. Across much of the ancient world, the role of women was reduced to the domestic sphere, while philosophy was seen as a public activity. Despite this, Hipparchia fearlessly makes a claim for women\u0026rsquo;s voices within the public sphere. Two other early women philosophers elsewhere in the world — Jing Jiang in China, and Gārgī Vācaknavī in India — also used the rhetoric of weaving to claim legitimacy when engaging in philosophical debate. But Hipparchia goes one further than either of these thinkers, and in her spat with Theodorus refuses outright the cultural assumption that women should give their attention only to weaving. In doing so, she makes an argument for Cynic universality.\nNotes [1] The Cynic Philosophers from Diogenes to Julian, ed.

            "title": "Zeno of Citium and the Challenge of Living Naturally",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "The first Stoic Zeno of Citium—not to be confused with Zeno of Elea—was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy. In recent years, Stoicism has seen a huge resurgence, both as an area of academic interest, and also as a popular philosophy offering guidance in our everyday lives. But how did it all begin?\nLife Zeno (334-262 BCE) came from the city of Citium in Cyprus, but like many philosophers of his day, he eventually ended up in Athens, the intellectual hub of the ancient Greek world. Diogenes Laërtius, everyone\u0026rsquo;s favourite unreliable narrator, tells us several things about Zeno\u0026rsquo;s life, most of which are probably spurious. Diogenes says Zeno “had a neck that was bent to one side”, that he was “thick-legged, flabby, and weak,” and that he liked green figs and sunbathing.\nA journey to Athens Diogenes also says that Zeno was a merchant. He turned up in Athens at the age of thirty after a shipwreck. Then he wandered into a bookshop and picked up a copy of Xenophon\u0026rsquo;s Memorabilia, an account of the life of Socrates. Zeno was deeply impressed and asked the bookseller where he could find somebody like Socrates. At that moment, Crates the Cynic philosopher happened to be going past the bookshop, and the bookseller said, “Follow him!” So Zeno did.\nCrates was himself a follower of the philosopher Diogenes of Sinope (who is not the same Diogenes as Diogenes Laërtius!), the founder of the Cynic school. The Cynics were preoccupied with the question of what it meant to live in accord with nature. In pursuit of this, they embraced public shamelessness and turned their back on the social conventions of their day.\nZeno took on the idea of living in accord with nature, but he had no taste for shamelessness. Diogenes of Sinope was fond of demonstrating his commitment to all things natural by masturbating in public, but this simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t Zeno\u0026rsquo;s kind of thing. It\u0026rsquo;s not for everyone. So Zeno continued his philosophical search.\nIn the painted porch Although some of the roots of Stoicism can be found in the teachings of the Cynic school, Zeno was also impressed by the followers of Socrates. For some time in Athens, he studied with Polemo, who was the head of Plato\u0026rsquo;s academy. But in the end, he broke with the Platonist school, just as he had broken with the Cynics. And eventually, Zeno set up a school of his own, sometime around the year 300 BCE.\nThe philosophical school founded by Zeno met at the stoa poikile, or “painted porch”, a covered walkway filled with paintings of historical and mythical battles. Because of their chosen meeting-place, this group of philosophers eventually became known as the Stoics.\nReconstruction of a painting from the Stoa Poikile. Carl Robert 1895. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nZeno wrote a number of books, including a Republic, influenced by the Republic of Plato, and a book called On Living in Accord with Nature. But none of these books has survived. Nevertheless, Zeno\u0026rsquo;s teaching was immediately popular. And the school he founded went on to become one of the most influential and long-lived in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds.\nPhilosophy The three pillars of philosophy Contemporary accounts of Stoic philosophy often present it simply as a set of practical guidelines for how we should live. But for Zeno, the question of how to live couldn\u0026rsquo;t be severed from deeper philosophical questions. So Zeno divided philosophy into three broad areas of inquiry: logic, physics and ethics.\nFor Zeno, logic is essentially about how we think about the world, both individually and collectively. So it includes a whole range of different disciplines, including rhetoric (the arts of persuasion), grammar, theories of perception, questions about knowledge and so on.\nPhysics is about the nature of the universe. For the Stoics, this isn\u0026rsquo;t simply about the universe as a natural entity: they also saw the universe as something divine. So physics for the Stoics involves investigating the universe on the understanding that it is both natural and divine.\nFor the Stoics, the cosmos as a whole is underpinned by logos or reason, which pervades the entire universe like a kind of fire (see also the philosopher file on Heraclitus). Reason, the Stoics argued, is an integral aspect of the material nature of the unfolding cosmos. And this is why the cosmos as a whole can be said to be divine: God, for the Stoics, is nothing other than the creative, productive aspect of the unfolding cosmos.\nFinally, there is ethics, or questions about how to live. This is the part of Stoicism that people most often talk about today in self-help manuals. The Stoic ideal is to live in accord with nature, to adjust our expectations and ways of living so that we are not pushing up against the limits of our nature, but are instead fully in accord with the nature of things. But for Zeno, these questions about how to live in accord with nature cannot be separated from questions about how to think and reason better about nature, and questions about the nature of the universe itself.\nThe good, the bad, and the indifferent… Although the Stoics share with the Cynics the idea of living in accord with nature, for Zeno, this is a more complicated business than the Cynics suspected. Living a better life (ethics) also implies understanding the way the universe is (physics), and finding better ways of thinking and talking about it (logic).\nIf we really want to live in accord with nature, we can\u0026rsquo;t just drop out and live in an abandoned wine-jar, as Diogenes of Sinope did. We have to investigate what nature is, and we have to reason better about nature. Only then can we find a way of living that is in accord with nature, because what is natural is neither obvious nor immediately apparent.\nThis made the Stoics much more sympathetic to the concerns of everyday folks than the Cynics were. Zeno understood that shelter, a regular supply of food, clothing and comfort were everyday human needs. The Cynics turned their back on these everyday comforts, seeing them as unnatural. They claimed that we should be indifferent to such things because, being unnatural, they have no moral value. But Zeno took a softer line. These things are important, he recognised, even they are not morally important. There are many things in the world that we can claim are good and bad without having to claim that these things are morally good and bad. Not all values are moral values.\nFor Zeno, things are morally good or bad if they pertain directly to virtue and vice. But the great mass of things in the world are simply morally indifferent. Nevertheless, that\u0026rsquo;s not to say that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t reasonably prefer some of these morally indifferent things to others. Sickness is a good example. Sickness is not morally bad, and health is not morally good. But it is perfectly reasonable to prefer health to sickness. Health is valuable, even if it isn\u0026rsquo;t good in the same sense that virtue is good.\nA practical philosophy For the Stoics, ultimately, the only truly good thing in human life is the pursuit of virtue, which also implies living in accord with nature. The Stoics can make this claim because of their assertion that nature itself is divine. When we live in accord with nature, we also live in accord with the divine.\nAll this means that for the Stoics, we should prefer the pursuit of virtue to the pursuit of other good things. But this also means that the ultimate purpose of philosophy is practical. Through careful inquiry into the universe, through better reasoning, and through living in accord with virtue, we can attain what Zeno once called a “smooth flow of life.” And we can thereby live a truly philosophical existence.\nFurther Reading Books and articles One of the best introductory books on Stoicism is Stoicism by John Sellars (Acumen 2006). More recently, Sellars has written a more popular book called Lessons in Stoicism (Penguin 2019), and this too is well worth reading.\nYou can also try Brad Inwood\u0026rsquo;s Stoicism: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2018).\nOnline Resources Is Stoicism one of the best mind-hacks ever?

Much philosophy in the West, from Plato and Socrates onwards, is tangled up with various forms of mysticism, and with a preoccupation with the divine. And throughout Asia, there are traditions of thought that are resolutely this-worldly.\nIn India, there has long been a robust strain of this-worldly philosophy. This philosophical tradition is usually referred to as Cārvāka. The derivation of the word is contentious, but in some accounts, it comes from a root meaning either “to chew on”, or else “sweet speech.” From around the sixth century, the Cārvāka philosophical tradition was also referred to as the Lokāyata, deriving from the expression lokeṣu āyatam, meaning widespread among the people.\nThe Cārvāka school traces its origins back to a set of obscure, lost texts called the Bārhaspatya sūtras, attributed to an author called Bṛhaspati. We don\u0026rsquo;t know much about the author, not least because there are no fewer than twenty-nine Bṛhaspatis in the ancient Indian tradition, so there\u0026rsquo;s lots of scope for confusion around which is which. Some accounts claim the author of these texts was none other than the sage Bṛhaspati, who was a teacher to the gods. In this version of events, Bṛhaspati taught the doctrine of materialism to deceive and bring ruin to the demons.\nWhoever the author of these early materialist texts was, most of what remains of these traditions is only fragmentary, making it hard to pin down in detail what ancient Indian materialist philosophy looked like. But one of the earliest philosophers associated with the Cārvāka traditions is a character who can be found lurching occasionally into view in the religious texts of the Buddhists and the Jains, dressed in a hairy blanket.\nThe Man With the Hairy Blanket Ajita Keśakambalin was a man of simple tastes. A contemporary of the Buddha, he too was a renunciant who had given up the household life in favour of the life of a wandering philosopher. His name literally means “Ajita of the Hairy Blanket”, and as far as it is possible to tell, he roamed about India wearing nothing but a blanket woven out of hair. We don\u0026rsquo;t know anything first-hand about Ajita\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, but we do know a little about how his opponents saw him.\nIn the Buddhist text, the Sāmaññaphala Sutta, or the Discourse on the Fruits of the Ascetic Life, we meet King Ajātasattu. The king has a problem on his hands. He has not long before imprisoned his father, Bimbisāra, ordered his torture and left him to die. Now Ajātasattu is worried about the consequences of his deeds. So he sets about interviewing the philosophers of his realm, the see if there is anyone whose teaching might bring him peace.\nOne of the philosophers he speaks with is Ajita. The text tells us that Ajita is already in old age, and has quite a sizeable community of followers. However, Ajita\u0026rsquo;s philosophy offers no comfort for a king in search of moral reform.\nAjita said: ‘Great king, there is no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight. This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a doctrine of morons. When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just hollow, false nonsense. Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death.’\nCame in Like a Wrecking Ball If we are to believe the Buddhist texts, Ajita\u0026rsquo;s philosophy was almost entirely destructive. He disavowed almost every moral, philosophical and religious doctrine of his day. He argued that there was no karma, no fruit of good deeds. There was no rebirth. There was no point in making offerings and sacrifices to the gods. Ethics itself was a sham. And wisdom didn\u0026rsquo;t help you much because the wise also die. In the world of Ancient Indian philosophy, Ajita came in like a wrecking ball and messed everything up.\nBut did the Cārvāka philosophers have anything more positive to contribute? If you read the text carefully, you can see that there is a positive claim here as well. There\u0026rsquo;s a very specific assertion that we are made up of four elements that have coalesced temporarily to fashion us, and that on our death will break apart. What are we? Ajita\u0026rsquo;s answer is this: we are nothing more than earth and water, fire and air (exactly the same list of elements that appears in the work of the philosopher Empedocles in Greece). And for Ajita, even the self or the soul is nothing more than a combination of these four elements.\nThe four elements of Empedocles. From Lucretius De rerum natura, published by Tommaso Ferrando, Brescia, 1472. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nHedonism, Asceticism, or Something in Between? This materialist view means that many of the ethical claims of the ancient Indian world have to be thrown out. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to fret over rebirth, because when we\u0026rsquo;re gone, we\u0026rsquo;re simply gone. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about the fruits of our good and bad deeds, because the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like this.\nBut does this mean that Cārvāka philosophy didn\u0026rsquo;t have any ethics to offer at all? After all, ethics is inescapable. Even if you undermine all the traditional frameworks there are for understanding ethics, you are still left with the question: how should I live?\nOne answer is that we should simply grab all the pleasure that we can, while we can. The Cārvāka philosophers were often associated with hedonism, the notion that pleasure is the sole end of human life. One preserved early fragment seems to suggest this:\nWhile life remains let a man live happily; nothing is beyond death. When once the body becomes ashes, how can it even return again? [1]\nAnother version of this same verse takes things even further, reading, “While life remains, let a man live happily, let him feed on ghee even though he runs into debt.”\nThis might seem strong evidence that the Cārvāka philosophers were committed to living it up. But the difficulty with this is that when we look at Ajita\u0026rsquo;s own mode of living, we find something that seems a long way from outright hedonism. Going around India dressed in a hairy blanket doesn\u0026rsquo;t look much like a life committed to wild, hedonistic excess.\nPerhaps if the Cārvāka texts had survived, we would have more insights into the varieties of ethics they proposed. But the example of Ajita suggests that other responses than outright hedonism are possible. It is true that living happily might mean feasting on ghee until you are driven into debt. But then again, it might mean living simply, dressed in a hairy blanket, wandering where you choose, a way of life closer to that of the Cynics in Ancient Greece, than to the image of a hedonist addicted to bodily pleasure.\nNotes: [1] R.

            "tags": ["Interviews",],
            "content": "On Philosophy, Mountains and Finding Your Deepest Impulse Sophie Grace Chappell is a philosopher, a poet, a mountaineer and a trans woman. She was born in Lancashire in 1964, and educated at Bolton School and Magdalen College, Oxford. She has taught at Oxford, UEA, Manchester, and Dundee. Since 1998, she has lived in Dundee with her family.\nHer last book is Knowing What To Do (OUP 2014), and her next book is Epiphanies (OUP 2022).\nQ: I’m always interested in how people end up becoming philosophers. What was it that led you to philosophy? And what keeps you doing philosophy? Two things overdetermine both that I got into it, and that I keep doing it. One is that I’m an argumentative so-and-so. Like the chap in the Monty Python sketch, “I like a good argument”. I enjoy debate, and thinking things through, and getting the logical components interlocking smoothly in the machinery, or pointing out that in someone else’s machinery, they don’t interlock smoothly. The competitive or combative or aggressive aspect of philosophy. That’s the Rottweiler side of me, as I sometimes put it.\nBut there’s another side to me. I also have what you might—if you’re a Nigel Molesworth fan—call a Fotherington-Thomas side, a “Hello clouds, hello sky” dreamy poetic side. A mystical side maybe; certainly a contemplative side. And this moves me towards philosophy too, only from the other direction as it were. I want to do philosophy at the point where these two desires intersect: the desire to be precise and to call out imprecision and incoherence and flannel and posturing codswallop, and the desire to be transcendent, to say something that matters, that goes to the heart of things. I rather think that’s how Plato got to philosophy, too.\nSo of course you love it when you’re developing your own contemplative take on something. And if you’re gnarly-minded enough—I certainly am, and so was Plato—you love it too when you’re taking a combative approach to someone else’s contemplativeness. What I don’t enjoy—and Plato didn’t either!—is when someone gets all combative about my contemplativeness… which no doubt will happen when the book reviewers get to Epiphanies.\nEpiphanies is a very Fotherington-Thomas sort of book. I have tried to Rottweiler-proof it, to some extent; I certainly want it to be a justification of a sort of contemplative approach to philosophy that stands up to scrutiny. But not much can stand up to a really determined—and unsympathetic—Rottweiler. When the reviews come out I’ll just have to suck it up, I guess. Serves me right for dishing it out to others so often, earlier in my career. (I like to think I’m less of a Rottweiler than I used to be, though maybe that’s just self-deception.)\nQ: You are, as the Guardian has written, the UK’s only trans philosophy professor. I’d love to know about the deeper connections between your life as a philosopher and your identity as a trans woman. Has philosophy helped you make sense of these questions of identity? (And if so, how?) What you immediately put me in mind of here is some remarks of Bernard Williams’ that I quoted in my Stanford Encyclopedia article on him. At the outset of his writing career (I said there), Williams took for his own “a phrase of D.H. Lawrence’s in his splendid commentary on the complacent moral utterances of Benjamin Franklin: ‘Find your deepest impulse, and follow that’” (1972: 93). Thirty years later he added, when looking back over his career, “If there’s one theme in all my work it’s about authenticity and self-expression… It’s the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren’t…. The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity.” Yes, that; very much that, about me and transgender. An inner necessity, a need to be authentically and above all openly who I actually am, is exactly what it’s all been about.\nHowever, that doesn’t mean that I have a theory of transgender to offer. I doubt I do. For reasons I’ve been talking about in various publications, including Knowing What To Do and Epiphanies—and a lot of these reasons have quite a lot to do with lines of anti-theory argument in ethics that Bernard Williams pursued too—I tend to steer away from philosophical theories of anything, at least in those parts of philosophy that aren’t best understood as handmaids of science. I think the real truth of things often eludes systematisation; even in science too, actually.\nAnd anyway, what is the theory supposed to do? Can we really not understand that murder is at least typically and maybe always wrong, or that love is usually a good thing, or that flowers are generally beautiful, till we have a philosophical theory that explains why? And what is “explanation” here? Why is some set of words, arranged in propositions with inferential relations between them, what we need to understand the goodness of love or the badness of murder? That seems to me an odd picture of what understanding is. Understanding, as I understand it, can be verbal and articulate, but quite often it isn’t at all, and oftener still the propositionally articulated bit isn’t the only part. Science limns the structure of reality, as Quine says in Word and Object. Sure it does, at least if it’s any good; but so does poetry too, if it’s any good. There isn’t just one correct way to grasp the deep structure of things; there are lots because there are lots of things we might call the deep structure of things. Propositional structures are great for the understanding, but experience matters too, and experience is no less cognitive for being, sometimes, non-discursive and not expressible in propositions.\nWell, I feel the force of all these considerations about theorising about transgender in particular. It should be experience first, theory later—if at all. Also, with particular reference to this case of transgender, I am always saying—because I think it’s true—that trans people don’t owe cis people, or anyone else, an explanation of why they’re who they are; any more than gay people do, for instance, or black people or Jewish people, or any other historically stigmatised minority. Right now, there are far too many people saying that we who are transgender have to prove our right to exist before they’ll take us seriously or accept us as fellow human beings. That’s the demand of which I think it’s right to say that there should be no “transgender debate”. Our right to be ourselves is not up for discussion. We shouldn’t be refused admission to society until we’ve arrived at a theory of transgender that is “satisfactory” (to whom?).\nAt the same time, by and large cis people who haven’t personally encountered it don’t understand transgender. The commonest reaction is probably “OK, fine; I don’t get it, but live and let live”. And people like that do deserve an explanation, an account or an elucidation or a story about us because they’re not just trying to knock us down; their lack of understanding is benign, and not wilful.\nTo people like them, what I suppose I want to say is something like this. At least as I understand and experience it, being transgender is fundamentally about finding that your body is one way, in my case the male way, and you wish it were the other way, the female way. And if you’re transgender that wish, that longing, is not a whim or a passing fancy but an immensely powerful longing and yearning, and fundamental to your psyche. And it begins when you do. It’s not a sexual thing, it goes much deeper than that, and for a lot of us, me included, it’s among the first things we were ever aware of. And if it is there, you can’t make it go away by wanting to. I tried that, I saw it as my religious and moral duty to try, for 33 years, and the pressure of the repressed desire became absolutely intolerable. It was tearing me apart. So I had to try something else. So after a rather confused decade, from about 2008 onwards I tried living as a woman: presenting as female, living in society as a woman—or at least as a trans woman—and did it with gradually increasing confidence and openness.\nNow it doesn’t solve everything to do that. I mean, if it’s fundamental to your psyche that you wish with all your heart that you’d been born female, but you’re perfectly well aware that you weren’t, then there’s only so much that can be done about that sense of mismatch. After a certain point, all trans people have to accept a compromise; the only question is where they’ll stop, and of course, the answers are different for different individuals. But what is clearly true is that no other solution comes anywhere near helping a trans person as much as it helps them to transition.\nAnd if you’re young enough, and if there aren’t medical obstacles, no doubt that often means a full medical and surgical transition too. I was immensely struck by seeing on the internet recently the sheer joy that it gives trans men to have “top surgery”, to have their bodies realigned to fit more closely with their sense of who they are. To deny trans people this sort of bodily autonomy, this sort of choice over their own destinies—to insist that born biology is an unbreakable and unalterable destiny, that the body is what Plato thought it was, a prison—that seems to me the height of callousness and cruelty.\nBut here we are in the UK in a situation where in practice it takes at least 5 years even to get to the beginning of the NHS process of transgender healthcare, and where the same so-called “gender critical” voices that have pushed the vulnerable trans minority in our society into what is, for many individuals, a truly desperate situation—people are committing suicide because of the suffering their untreated gender dysphoria is causing them—those voices will be only too happy to make things even worse for transgender people if they get the chance. And they might well get the chance, given this government’s extraordinary willingness to engage in what they like to call culture wars. If only there were less of this sort of toxicity and cruelty around today.\nQ: Contrary to the usual image of a philosopher as somebody sedentary, you have a fondness for extreme sports, in particular mountaineering. In what ways are philosophy and mountaineering alike? Or are they entirely different things? Well, I talked about philosophising out of a coalescence of the instincts of a logician on the one hand, and of a mystic on the other. You get the same interaction of potentially conflicting impulses—and the same sort of resultant rows between people—in climbing. Climbing is, in a way, about solving problems in applied engineering. What application of what physical forces, at what angles, with what leverage and what counterpoising, will enable me to get this slow weak heavy body of mine to the top of this fantastic piece of smooth vertical rock? (Or, in winter, ice?) And how do I protect myself as I go? But in another way, you might say that climbing is not applied engineering at all; it’s more like a spiritual discipline—and it can be a mystical experience. I mean, if it wasn’t for the Wow Moments, the Peak Experiences, the Epiphanies, why would we climb at all? To keep fit? To attract sexual partners? I don’t really think so.\nSophie Grace scaling philosophical peaks. Image © Simon Richardson. Used with permission.\nThe truth is, of course, that climbing is both engineering and epiphany at once, and all my favourite writers on climbing register this bipolarity in one way or another. W.H.Murray for example, whose Mountaineering In Scotland is both the diary of a techno-wonk precisian (by the standards of his time: we’re a lot more techno-wonk-y now!) and also an elegy to a land he longed for. (It was famously written by Murray in a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany in 1944, on the only paper available to him, toilet-roll; the guards confiscated it, so he wrote the whole thing out again, on more toilet-roll.) Or again, my friend Stephen Venables—who is both a skilled woodworker and a passionate Chopin-player—writes wonderfully in his various books both about the technical side of climbing, and also about its epiphanic aspect. Or to name another friend, Simon Richardson combines almost mathematically exact route-descriptions with one of the most wonderful climbing-book titles I know, Chasing The Ephemeral. Climbing too is both technical precision, and also dreamy elevation. Maybe that’s why I love it in its different way just as much as I love philosophy—though I am definitely less gifted on the climbing side than in philosophy, that’s for sure.\nOn Knowing What to Do Q: I want to talk about your book, Knowing What to Do, which argues for an approach to ethics that traces its roots back to Plato. But first, I want to ask about your own relationship with Plato’s thought. When did your interest in Plato begin? And why? When I was growing up my family had in the house a copy of that old Penguin, The Last Days Of Socrates, with Apology, Crito, Phaedo in it. I expect it was my mother’s copy; she did an Open University degree in English and Philosophy in the early seventies, despite already having a Manchester University degree in English. So I suppose I started reading and rereading it when I was about 10. I was fascinated by the idea of “following the argument wherever it goes”, and both perplexed and excited by Socrates’ apparent confidence that that’s all you need to do to get to the truth. And the Socrates-versus-Plato dynamic intrigued me from the start. To use my terms above, Socrates was so clearly a Rottweiler, Plato so clearly a Fotherington-Thomas. I got on to the idea that there was a deep divide between them, all by myself. I didn’t need to read the scholarship, or to know it even existed, to see that Plato was putting things into Socrates’ mouth, in the Phaedo in particular. Because it just wasn’t—I reasoned—natural to suppose that we would get to those conclusions, like reincarnation and recollection and the Forms, simply by following our logical noses. Those are conclusions of revelation, not of reason; and being as I am a Christian, I was interested too in the question what beliefs you could get out of reason alone, and what beliefs needed revelation to support them. But Plato, I thought—and think—never really tried, in the Phaedo, seriously to suggest that he was getting his “Socrates” to his conclusions by reason alone. There was plenty of “as we know from those old-familiar arguments of ours” to be found in the text. Plenty of appeal, too, to dreams and prophets and fairy-stories.\nAnother thing that interested me straight away in the arguments in Plato’s dialogues—I’m afraid it’s a bit meta—was about, so to speak, the granularity of the arguments. Socrates is very keen to proceed a single step of argument at a time. But what counts as a single step in argument, and why? Is logical space basically a continuum, so that anyone who defines minima, pixels, atoms, unitary steps, within logical space is making a particular decision about how to carve things up that could have been decided otherwise? Or is logical space naturally and essentially pixellated, atomic, granular?\nAt any rate it was very obvious to me, when I read Plato, that what struck him as a basic unit of inference, what he counted as a single step in the argument, was different from what strikes us today. So what followed from that difference? Well, it meant either that Plato had things all wrong—he was dividing logical space up incorrectly. Or that we have it all wrong, and Plato was right. Or that we and Plato are both wrong, and some third account of the basic structure of logical space is available elsewhere, or is yet to be discovered. Or again, perhaps, that the very idea of logical space is a relativistic notion. That what you count as a single step in argument is determined by some feature of your context. But then, if so, which feature?\nThe obvious suggestion is of course that it’s our languages that do the relativising. But if that’s right, then a whole research agenda hoves into view: we need to think about how the language that we do philosophy in, affects—perhaps even determines—the philosophy that we’re able to do. I didn’t really have the vocabulary to express all this clearly when I was 12 or 14 (perhaps I still don’t). But I do think these considerations give us one reason why it’s essential for philosophers not to be monoglots. We should always be wary of the language that we work in, whether English or German or propositional calculus or whatever. We should never allow people to talk about “ordinary-language philosophy” or “linguistic intuitions” without retorting “Which language?” We should never stop pushing the question “What does my own medium for thought obscure from my own thinking?” I think this wariness about language and logic is one of the best things that reading Plato in Greek can give you. Though of course you can also get it by reading Kant in German, or Descartes in French, or Augustine in Latin. Or Laozi or Advaita Vedanta in Chinese or Sanskrit (I don’t read either, unfortunately).\nSo these were aspects of Plato’s works that interested me straight away when I was 10 or 12 years old—and still interest me today. Above all: the idea of getting to the Platonic heaven simply by question-and-answer argument: well, wow. It might not actually work, but what an incredible wheeze. I say something about that, too, towards the end of Epiphanies.\nQ. At the outset of Knowing What to Do, you talk about the failure of systematic moral theories. What are systematic moral theories? And why do you think they fail? A systematic moral theory is, roughly, an approach to thinking about what to do which derives conclusions about what to do in particular cases from the most general possible principles about what to do in any case whatever, and which aspires to give the greatest possible number of explanations and justifications of action on the basis of the smallest possible of theoretical posits, axioms, or assumptions. The most familiar examples of systematic moral theory in this sense are the various forms of Kantianism, consequentialism, contractualism, natural law theory, and so on; virtue ethics can sometimes be presented as a systematic moral theory too.\nI say more—a lot more, 220,000 words more—about all this in Epiphanies. But very briefly, a theory like that fails for reasons that Bernard Williams and David Wiggins put very well in this passage from their introduction to Aurel Kolnai’s collected essays:\nIn science theorists hope to find a few principles from which everything else will be deducible. There are more serious reasons than purely aesthetic for wanting that—clarity, the hope that the drive towards it will reveal error wherever it exists, the subsumption of many diverse phenomena under one satisfying description. But in the case of moral philosophy what defines the subject is a highly heterogeneous set of human concerns, many of them at odds with many others of them, many of them incommensurable with many others of them. In this case there is no reason to think that what is needed is a theory to discover underlying order. This is not a subject after all where very much is hidden. Or rather what is hidden is hidden in a psychological or interpretive sense. There is no question of a secret axiological ordering principle. There is no deeper level of reality, comparable to the microscopic or sub-microscopic level explored by chemistry and physics, which it is the moral philosopher’s duty to probe. And where one can make no sense of there being such a level, the idea, urged by some moral philosophers, of finding the “simplest theory” which “will save the phenomena” (in the normal acceptation of the phrase) is nearly meaningless.\nQ: As an alternative approach, you talk about the moral imagination. It might be tempting to boil this down to something systematic as well; but your own position seems much more baggy, generous and unsystematic. So, speaking unsystematically, what do you mean by moral imagination? This is difficult to answer briefly, because, yes, I am speaking unsystematically when I talk about moral imagination. I mean lots of different things by the phrase. In Chapter 2 of Knowing What To Do I picked out three. One is something like empathy, the ability to put yourself in someone else’s shoes; I get into that by beginning from a contrast between two people encountering an alien race—one of them is Patrick Leigh Fermor and the other is Adolf Hitler. The other two things I mean are in different ways both about the ability to question the framing of a moral question, in particular a moral question that is presented as a dilemma that is supposed to lead us to general theoretical conclusions, like ticking-bomb scenarios or trolley problems. About problems like that I find I very often want to say “Never mind what the answer is; why are we accepting the question?” Why, that is, should we accept the whole way the problem is framed for us, as if there were something neutral or inevitable about that? That, as Wittgenstein might put it, is where the sleight of hand, the conjuror’s trick, has happened already: in the way the question was set up, which, unfortunately for us, we never thought to query. In this sense I think contemporary moral theory is full of leading questions. And I’m deeply suspicious of leading questions.\nBy saying that we can pick out these three kinds of moral imagination, I didn’t at all mean that they’re the only kinds. Far from it. And in any case, another thing I’m deeply suspicious of in contemporary moral theory is allegedly comprehensive catalogues of types of things; they almost never turn out to be truly comprehensive, and then people contort themselves gratuitously to save the quite unnecessary assumption that they have to be comprehensive. But there are other possibilities for what we might mean by “moral imagination”. In the new book, in Epiphanies, I have a fair bit to say about how the imagination feeds off, is psychically nourished by, the kinds of permanent image for the soul that Jung calls an archetype; this happens with art and religion in particular. But also, and I developed this idea in the last chapter of Knowing What To Do, simply to truly understand anything that confronts us is an exercise of the imagination, too: it is a kind of Murdochian attention or attentiveness.\nQ: One of the things that you get from Plato is the role of contemplation in developing moral imagination. What does it mean to contemplate? And how do you go about it practically? Like I say, it’s about attention, about fixed and undivided still gazing upon something. Murdoch talks about this in The Sovereignty of Good, and it’s hard to improve on what she said there. It’s a spiritual discipline; it’s an encounter with reality; and it’s a kind, perhaps the central kind, of love. We fix our minds with an effort at love and truthfulness and justice on what is there, what is really there, before us. To understand is to become still to ourselves, and still in ourselves; and alive to the object of attention, outside our selves. This is also, I think, what poets do, or try to do. It’s certainly what I attempt in my own poetry.\nIs it too pretentious to try and show what I mean by citing, indeed reciting, a poem that I wrote? This poem is about two of my own children as pet-keepers, and how I saw, in them and in their care for their pets—as it happened to be, a goldfish and a stick-insect—just this kind of contemplative love.\nTwo pets\nThe power of human sight. The hanging hawk is only awaiting prey, but turns, observed, to picture, image, symbol; becomes framed. The power of human focus, of the rapt attent that constellates the sky and names the species, that populates the peaceful empty fields quiet with cow-pats and the small life of birds.\nOr how a blank-eyed pebble-turning fish, bobbing in plastic weeds its simple scales, or furtive exoskeletal invertebrate, six legs and mouth-parts, stalking unawares within a human ten-year-old’s arc-light awareness, is turned into a burning-point of love; is seen and by this concentration made something very good.\nGoldfish. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nQ: As we are talking about moral imagination, it strikes me that the inability to accept the experience of those who identify as transgender is, in large part, a failure of the moral imagination. If so, how do we move forward from here? I think that’s right: the debate has got bogged down in a kind of dogmatism, a kind of refusal to listen to transgender people. How do we move forward? Well, we stop refusing to listen, and start listening.\nOne very obvious arena where this needs to happen is the British press. The papers at present are full of articles about transgender people; but these articles are hardly ever by transgender people. Our voices are ignored or suppressed, and we personally are demonised and dehumanised. There isn’t a subtle or complicated solution to this problem. It just needs to stop. It simply needs to change.\nOn Friendship, Epiphanies and Writing and Reading What You Want Q: What’s next on the horizon for you and your work? Epiphanies will, I hope, be out before too long, and certainly in 2022 at the latest. It’s a book about peak experiences, Wow moments and Aha moments, and what they might be for ethical philosophers; how we might build a philosophical outlook that takes these experiences seriously. So that’s in the pipeline. So too is a volume of my poems! Songs For Winter Rain; I’m not sure when that will actually appear, but fairly soon, I think. It has “Two Pets” in it.\nPhilosophically, right now, I am thinking about how to take forward the philosophical programme that Epiphanies advances. It’s the same programme as I was already pursuing in Ethics and Experience and Knowing What To Do, only, as Hegel would say, things come to self-consciousness as they unfold. You get clearer about what it is that you’re trying to do, as you carry on doing it.\nThere’s also a short book on Friendship to be written, contracted to CUP. How that will go, and how much it will connect with the philosophical agenda of Epiphanies, I really have no idea. I’m certainly not going to force the friendship book to be somehow on the same page as the stuff on epiphanies. Maybe it belongs there and maybe it doesn’t; who knows?\nThis is the great thing about philosophy, and what keeps me going at it: it’s so unpredictable. I simply have no idea where the argument might lead me. But nearly always, so far, to a good place.\nQ: Finally, if you could give any advice to an aspiring philosopher, what would it be? Two things, I think. They both sound a bit defiant-individualist, and I don’t want to lean too far into that, because philosophy is and should be a dialectical and conversational enterprise, and so it does matter what feedback other people give you.\nHowever, philosophy as it is—I mean mainly academic philosophy, but it’s more widely true than that—is a real hall of mirrors: everyone is looking for everyone else’s approval all the time, and that kind of peer pressure becomes not just intellectually stultifying but institutionally tyrannical as well.\nSo first, read the books and papers, and write the books and the papers, that you want to read and to write, not that other people tell you to.\nAnd secondly: don’t measure yourself by other people’s measures of status. Don’t play the hall of mirrors game. What matters is whether the work you produce is any good. Measure yourself by that. And while philosophy is unendingly difficult and demanding, don’t be too hard on yourself.\nSophie Grace Chappell is Professor of Philosophy at The Open University.\nImage © Sophie Grace Chappell.

            "content": "What\u0026rsquo;s the Point? What\u0026rsquo;s the point? Some time or other, we\u0026rsquo;ve all probably asked ourselves this question. What\u0026rsquo;s the point of doing what we are doing? What\u0026rsquo;s the point of our lives? What\u0026rsquo;s the point of human life in general?\nWhen we ask ourselves these questions, we are not just idly speculating about life. Instead, these are questions that we feel deeply and intensely. They have an existential weight behind them. After all, everything in human life—everything we think and do—seems to depend on the way that we answer these questions.\nIf you have ever been preoccupied with these questions, then you are not alone. They also preoccupied the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE). And in his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle takes these questions about the purpose, the point, or the end of human life, and he tackles them head-on.\nAbout the Nicomachean Ethics Before we launch into exploring how Aristotle goes about answering these questions, it is worth saying a bit more about the Nicomachean Ethics itself. The book is probably named after Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s son, Nicomachus (although, confusingly, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s father was also called Nicomachus). Some have said that Nicomachus edited the work, thereby lending it his name; but the evidence for this is slim, particularly given that Nicomachus himself died young.\nAs a book, the Nicomachean Ethics*—*like many of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s surviving works—reads somewhat sketchily. The book seems more like lecture notes than a final polished work for public consumption (there is evidence that the works Aristotle wrote for wider audiences were much more elegant). But for all this, the work is remarkably consistent and focussed. And it has remained influential down to the present day.\n15th Century Illustrated Edition of the Nicomachean Ethics. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nAiming at the Good The Nicomachean Ethics starts with a compelling assertion: that pretty much everything we do aims at some good.\nEvery skill and every inquiry, and similarly every action and rational choice, is thought to aim at some good; and so the good has been aptly described as that at which everything aims. (1094a).\nWhy do we get ourselves a cat? Because we think it will be a good thing to have a small, furry companion. Why do we learn to sing? Because we think it will be good to serenade our cat. Why do we want to move house? Because we think it will be good to live somewhere where the neighbours don\u0026rsquo;t complain when we sing to our cat at 3 am. And so on. Even the worst of human actions aims at some kind of good (Why do I want to unleash destruction on my enemies? So I can live out my days in peace, singing songs to my cat).\nBut Aristotle observes that many of the things we do are done not for their own sake, but for the sake of something else. The goods that we aim at are often only temporary or transitional goods, steps on the road to some higher good. We work so that we can make money. We make money so that we can buy a house. We buy a house so that we can have shelter, a foothold in the world. And so on.\nOften our desires are linked like this, as if they are a kind of chain: we want A so we can have B; we want B so we can have C; and we want C so we can have D… But these chains don\u0026rsquo;t go on forever. Eventually, you get to an endpoint. And that endpoint, Aristotle says, is happiness.\nWhy is happiness the end point? Because happiness is not something we want for the sake of something else. Instead, it is something we want for its own sake. After all, why do we want to be happy? Well, just because. So Aristotle concludes that happiness is the ultimate good because it is the one thing we want for its own sake.\nOn Being Good Spirited But what does Aristotle mean by happiness? He is not talking about enjoying our lives. Nor is he talking about the feeling of being happy, or having a life filled with pleasure. Instead, for Aristotle, happiness is about being able to fully express the excellence of human being. Happiness, he says, is the condition of “living well and doing well” (1095a).\nThe word that Aristotle uses for happiness is eudaimonia. In Greek, eu is a prefix meaning “good” or “well”, and daimon can mean “spirit”, “fortune” or “guiding spirit.” This is often translated as “flourishing.” The translation is imperfect. But it does at least bring home to us the idea that a good human life is a life in which—through living well and doing well—we fully express our human capacities. A flourishing grapevine grows strong and vigorous, doesn\u0026rsquo;t suffer from disease or drought, and produces bunches of excellent grapes. Similarly, a flourishing human life is a life where things go well for us, and where we bring forth excellent fruits.\nImage: 1879, Ensayo sobre las variedades de la vid común que vegetan en Andalucía. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nHuman Characteristics But what are these fruits? Up to this point, this may all seem still a little vague. And Aristotle himself admits that, at least at first glance, “saying that happiness is the chief good sounds rather platitudinous” (1097b). So what does it mean to live well and to do well?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go back to the question we started with: what is the point of human life? In pursuit of an answer to this question, Aristotle starts by asking about what he calls our characteristic activity (or ergon in Greek). The characteristic activity of something is what it is for—its purpose—if it is functioning optimally. The characteristic activity of a knife is cutting. The characteristic activity of the human eye is seeing. The characteristic activity of the tongue is tasting. The characteristic activity of the gut is digesting. And the characteristic activity of the optimally functioning gourmet chef is to put that knife to work to produce food that will please the eye, the tongue, and the gut.\nSo what, Aristotle asks, is the characteristic activity or the ergon of a human being? It is not just life because this is something we share with other animals and also with plants. It is an activity, but not the characteristic activity we have by virtue of being human. Nor is it sentience because this is something we share with other animals. Instead, Aristotle says, our characteristic activity is “a life, concerned in some way with action, of the element that possesses reason” (1098a). And, he adds, “the characteristic activity of the good person to be to carry this out well and nobly.”\nWho Flourishes? So what does it mean to flourish as a human being? And who gets the chance to flourish? So far, it looks as if flourishing is something that we ourselves enact through virtuous action. We act well in society with others, guided by reason, virtuously using our human capacities in pursuit of the good. And when we do this, then we can be said to be happy and flourishing.\nHowever, Aristotle recognises that eudaimonia or happiness is not just about internal conditions. The “guiding spirit” or daimon of eudaimonia is partly internal. But it is also partly to do with our attunement to the external world, and to our changing fortunes in the external world. To live well and to do well, you need the support of both external and internal conditions.\nAnd here Aristotle is clear-eyed about the extent to which flourishing is a function of our social position.\nHappiness obviously needs the presence of external goods as well, since it is impossible, or at least no easy matter, to perform noble actions without resources. For in many actions, we employ, as if they were instruments at our disposal, friends, wealth, and political power. (1099b)\nThis raises a question that Aristotle himself side-steps. If flourishing is the ultimate human good, it would seem to be an obviously good thing if as many people as possible could be said to flourish.\nBut if flourishing is important for human life, the question is this: how do we offset the inequities of fate and fortune to make sure that all can flourish, rather than the privileged few?\nFurther Reading Books and articles There are lots of translations of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Nicomachean Ethics out there.

            "content": "Life Aristotle is one of the most influential of all philosophers in the Greek tradition. He was Plato\u0026rsquo;s most famous student, but he ended up rejecting many of Plato\u0026rsquo;s central ideas, in particular his theory of forms. And he was a formative influence not only on the philosophical traditions of Europe but also on those of the Islamic world.\nHowever, if the ancient biographer Diogenes Laërtius is to be believed (which, alas, he isn\u0026rsquo;t always), Aristotle was quite a curious individual. He had skinny calves and small eyes. He dressed in fancy clothes, wore his hair short—not a fashion at the time—and had a fondness for elaborate rings. When he spoke, he spoke with a lisp. And although we are used to seeing images of Aristotle with a full beard, it is said he preferred to be cleanly shaven. He was, in short, an oddball.\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s Character This picture of Aristotle as an oddball may have something to do with the fact that he was always an outsider in Athens, and never became an Athenian citizen.\nAristotle was born in Stagira in Northern Greece in 384 BCE. His father was well-connected, possibly a doctor to the king of Macedon. His mother, too, seems to have been independently wealthy.\nSome later philosophers (Epicurus is one) suggest that while Aristotle was still young, he squandered part of his father\u0026rsquo;s fortune, then fled home to join the army. But, the stories go, he turned out to be a hopeless soldier, so he was thrown out of the army. After that, he made a living peddling dubious drugs, drawing on the knowledge of medicine that he had gleaned from his father.\nWell, maybe. Or maybe not. It was common in the ancient world for philosophers to launch ad hominem attacks on their philosophical rivals. Other accounts of Aristotle talk of him very differently: as someone who was generous-spirited, humble and exemplary in his behaviour.\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s Student Either way, what we do know with more certainty is that eventually—probably while still in his teens—Aristotle wound up in Athens, where he became a part of Plato\u0026rsquo;s circle.\nAristotle studied with Plato for the best part of two decades. But when Plato died in the year 347, Aristotle left Athens for the city of Assos, in present-day Turkey. There, he stayed with his friend Hermeias, another of Plato\u0026rsquo;s former students who had risen to become the tin-pot ruler of Assos. In Assos, Aristotle continued to study philosophy, but after the death of Hermeias, he moved again, this time across the water to Lesbos.\nThen in 343 BCE, Philip, the king of Macedon, summoned Aristotle to the capital city of Macedonia. There, Aristotle became a tutor to the king\u0026rsquo;s son, Alexander—later Alexander the Great.\nFrom the Vie des savants illustres - Savants de l\u0026rsquo;antiquité (tome 1), Paris, 1866. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nA New Research Community Aristotle taught Alexander for a couple of years, after which he kicked around Macedonia, developing his extensive work in natural history. But by 335 BCE, he was back in Athens where he set up his own philosophical circle, the Lyceum (named after the god Apollo Lykeios). He stayed for thirteen years.\nThe Lyceum functioned more or less like a research community. Aristotle and his students set about gathering together the world\u0026rsquo;s knowledge. The Lyceum was a place where people studied ethics and politics, history and medicine, the arts and biology. This breadth is reflected in the extraordinary range of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s philosophical work.\nIn 323 BCE. Alexander, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s former pupil and now the ruler of Macedon, died. With anti-Macedonian feeling high in Athens, Aristotle left the city for the island of Euboea. He died there the following year.\nPhilosophy Aristotle writes about pretty much everything. This inevitably makes him a somewhat daunting philosopher to read. Diogenes Laërtius says that he wrote one hundred and fifty volumes, many made up of multiple books. Not all of these books are still extant. But what remains is still breathtaking in its depth and its breadth.\nIn the *Poetics—*a book that is almost a Bible for some Hollywood screenwriters—Aristotle talks about storytelling and how it works.\nIn the Nicomachean Ethics, he talks about what it means to live a flourishing life, and how virtue is a central part of this flourishing.\nIn On the Soul, he asks profound questions about what makes us the unique individuals that we are.\nIn On Divination in Sleep, he talks about prophetic dreams.\nIn the *Movement of Animals—*one of his many treatises on biology—he explores (unsurprisingly, given the title) how animals move.\nIn the Constitution of the Athenians, he talks about the Athenian political system.\nAnd in the Politics, he talks about the practical business of how we exist, and how we can thrive, in social groups.\nWays of Knowing Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s work is so vast and extensive that, at first glance, it seems as if his interests are all over the place. How do you even think about subjects this diverse?\nBut one of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s most significant contributions was the insight that there are different ways of knowing appropriate to different domains. This allows him to structure and divide up human ways of knowing, to bring some order into this seeming chaos.\nFor Aristotle, you can divide knowledge into theoretical knowledge (theoria in Greek), practical knowledge (praxis), and productive knowledge (poiēsis). You could see these as knowing for its own sake, knowing for the sake of doing, and knowing for the sake of making.\nTheoretical knowledge has an element of standing back from the world and contemplating. The Greek word theoria is derived from the word theōros, which means a spectator—like a spectator in a theatre play. So this kind of knowledge includes things like knowledge of mathematics, physics, and metaphysics (those big questions like “what is time?”, “what is causation?” and so on).\nBut we are not just observers of the world. We are also beings who act, both individually and collectively, to bring about certain social or individual ends that we consider to be good. This is where practical knowledge comes in: the knowledge that involves questions about how we act in the world, whether individually (ethics) or in collectives (politics and economics).\nFinally, we don\u0026rsquo;t just think and do things. We also make things. We bring new things into being. This is productive knowledge: the kind of knowledge we need to throw pots, write plays, cook dinner, knit sweaters, paint pictures, or make chairs out of wood.\nGetting Philosophical About Cake Image: Corn, the food of the nation, US Food Administration poster 1918 (adapted). Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example of these different kinds of knowledge in action. Imagine you have three philosopher friends, all of whom have an interest in cake.\nOne friend excels in their knowledge of chemistry. They can tell you exactly what is going on when you mix cake ingredients and put them in the oven. But they can\u0026rsquo;t bake to save their lives. Friend number one excels in theoretical knowledge.\nAnother of your friends is skilled at arbitrating in tricky social disputes such as the question “Who should get the last slice of cake?” Friend number two knows just how to handle complex social and ethical situations. This is practical knowledge.\nFinally, imagine you have a third friend who is a superb baker. They flunked chemistry at school, and they\u0026rsquo;re not really particularly bothered by who gets to eat the cakes they make. But they have a profound understanding of the craft of combining ingredients to conjure perfect confections. This third kind of knowledge is productive knowledge.\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s insight is that the kinds of knowledge we need when knowing, doing, and making are all very different. Questions like, “What is the chemistry of baking?”, “To whom should I give the last slice?”, and “How do I make a cake?” are fundamentally different kinds of questions. And this means that they require fundamentally different kinds of answers.\nHuman ways of knowing are not single but multiple.\nFurther Reading Books and articles There are a lot of good introductory books on Aristotle. Try Jonathan Barnes\u0026rsquo;s Aristotle: A Very Short Introduction (OUP 2000). Christopher Shields\u0026rsquo;s Aristotle (Routledge 2007) is a very thorough and accessible introduction.\nEdith Hall\u0026rsquo;s Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Way (Penguin Random House 2015) mines Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s work for advice on how to live. It\u0026rsquo;s worth a read.\nThe entertainingly scurrilous versions of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s history, as well as a good weighing of the evidence, can be found in Carlo Natali\u0026rsquo;s Aristotle: His Life and School (Princeton University Press 2013).\nOnline To go a little bit deeper, read my piece on navigating wisdom with Aristotle.\n",

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Hui Shi (c. 370 — c. 310 BCE) was a Chinese philosopher known for his fascination with logical puzzles. He is considered as a representative of the School of Names, or in Chinese ming jia (see the philosopher file on Deng Xi). Hui Shi is famous, in particular, for his puzzling paradoxes that seem to share some resemblances with those of Zeno of Elea.\nAs with so many figures in early Chinese thought, the historical Hui Shi is frustratingly elusive. The sources more or less agree that he was a minister in the state of Wei, famous for his brilliance in argument, his love of word-play, and his enjoyment of paradox. And while some later accounts criticise him for his poor political judgement, even his enemies seemed to recognise his skill in weaving arguments.\nFriends and adversaries Some of the most famous passages about Hui Shi come from the Zhuangzi, where he is depicted as a friend and an adversary of the Daoist philosopher, Zhuang Zhou, also known as Zhuangzi. It is probably best to see these stories as fictional. But they say something about how Hui Shi was considered in the eyes of his contemporaries, and in the eyes of those who came after him.\nFrom the stories in the Zhuangzi, it appears that the two philosophers disagreed about almost everything. And as a whole, the Zhuangzi is unsparing in its criticism of Hui Shi. In one dialogue, Zhuangzi accuses Hui Shi of having “a lot of tangled weeds clogging up his mind.” But despite this robust criticism, the two philosophers nevertheless manage to get on. One of their most famous dialogues concerns the happiness of fish.\nZhuangzi and Huizi [Hui Shi] were strolling along the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, “The minnows swim about so freely, following the openings wherever they take them. Such is the happiness of fish.” Huizi said, “You are not a fish, so whence do you know the happiness of fish?” Zhuangzi said, “You are not I, so whence do you know I don’t know the happiness of fish?” Huizi said, “I am not you, to be sure, so I don’t know what it is to be you. But by the same token, since you are certainly not a fish, my point about your inability to know the happiness of fish stands intact.” Zhuangzi said, “Let’s go back to the starting point. You said, ‘Whence do you know the happiness of fish?’ Since your question was premised on your knowing that I know it, I must have known it from here, up above the Hao River.”\nThis passage about the happiness of fish gives rise to a multitude of questions that are often as slippery as the fish themselves. Can we understand fish? Can we conclude, as they dart through the reeds, that they are happy? By what means do we come to this conclusion? What if we see a fish out of water, gasping and flapping? Can we conclude that it is unhappy or distressed? Oddly, it seems easier to conclude that fish out of water are unhappy than it is to conclude that fish in water are happy. But why is this? And, for that matter, how can we understand each other, even if we are both human, and neither of us is a fish? How can we come to a mutual understanding? And once we have got there, how do we know we have got there? I am not you. You are not a fish. Where is the bridge that can unite us? Where can we stand to gain certain knowledge?\nSo, this little story raises all kinds of questions about knowledge, and how it is that we can claim to know anything at all. But it is worth remembering that it is also a story about two friends, wandering freely by the river, while they watch the fish wandering freely in the river below them. And as they wander, these two friends engage in a teasing, light-hearted debate about fish and pleasure. This story is not just about philosophical disagreements. It is also a model for how we should manage our disagreements.\nPhilosophy Analogies: a hall of mirrors Image of a woman looking at herself in a mirror. Attributed to Morikuni (Japan, 18th century). Via Wellcome Institute. Licence: CC-BY-4.0\nHui Shi was preoccupied with questions about knowledge. And so, it is no surprise that in the passage from the Zhuangzi, he is found asking how do you know that the fish are happy?\nFrom what we can reconstruct of his philosophy, it seems that for Hui Shi, all of our knowledge is tangled up with our ability to draw analogies. When we come across something new, we make sense of what it is by saying what it is like. This is how our knowledge of the world is built up: everything we know, we know by how it resembles something else.\nAnalogy helps us extend our knowledge of the world. And crucially, without using analogy, we are utterly lost. In a passage in the first century BCE text, the Shuo Yuan, there is a dialogue between Hui Shi and King Liang of Wei.\nA guest said to King Liang, \u0026ldquo;When Huizi speaks of things, he is apt to use analogies. But if you forbade him to use analogies, then he would have nothing to say.\u0026rdquo; Then the king said, \u0026ldquo;Indeed!\u0026rdquo; The following day the king saw Huizi, and he addressed him, saying, \u0026ldquo;I would like you to speak of things, but to talk directly, without using any analogies.\u0026rdquo; Huizi replied, \u0026ldquo;If somebody turned up here today and asked what a dan was, and you replied, \u0026lsquo;A dan is like a dan,\u0026rsquo; would this be informative?\u0026rdquo; The king replied, \u0026ldquo;It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;But if you go on to say, \u0026lsquo;a dan is like a bow, but it uses bamboo for its string,\u0026rsquo; wouldn\u0026rsquo;t they then know?\u0026rdquo; The King said, \u0026ldquo;They would.\u0026rdquo; Then Huizi said, \u0026ldquo;This is how explanation works: by taking something that is known to inform about things that are not known. Thus we get people to know. Your demand that I give up on analogy is impossible.\u0026rdquo; And the king said, \u0026ldquo;Excellent!\u0026rdquo;\nBut if analogy is essential to our knowing, there is a problem. And the problem is this: the chain of analogies can go on forever: X is like Y is like Z is like P is like Q, and so on, ad infinitum. So there is no place to stand outside this perpetual proliferation of analogies, where our knowledge of the world can be firmly anchored.\nLogical problems, and the love of all things However, perhaps Hui Shi is most well-known for his logical problems. These appear in a number of ancient Chinese texts, including a list of ten logical problems at the end of the Zhuangzi. Most of these problems are about how all of our distinctions are always made from a certain point of view. When we shift our point of view, we often find the problems themselves also shift, change or even disappear.\nSome of these problems seem close to the kinds of problems that Zeno of Elea chewed over. For example, the following paradox asks how a something with dimension can be made from infinitesimal points (for example, in the way a line is made from an infinity of dimensionless points in geometrical space).\nWhat has no thickness cannot be piled up, and yet it extends for a thousand miles.\nAnother paradox, a bit less abstract and closer to home, says that:\nJust as the sun slants as soon as it reaches high noon, all beings start dying as soon as they are born.\nLife and death may seem to be the opposite of each other. But, Hui Shi suggests, seen differently, they are inseparable: living is also dying.\nHui Shi\u0026rsquo;s detractors paint him as the enemy of morality. They claim he is a philosopher who just loves tying people up in knots. But perhaps he is the opposite. Once we see that our knowledge of the world is slippery and perspectival, when we understand that we grasp things only through the power of analogy, then we can become more appreciative of the connections between things. And we can see that the distinctions we make are less stark than we imagine them to be.\nAnd then—who knows?—perhaps this opens up a path to a kinder way of being in the world. At the end of the passage in the Zhuangzi, Hui Shi echoes an idea from the philosopher Mozi, who talked about “universal care.” But while Mozi suggested that we should care for all other human beings impartially, the perspective from Hui Shi is broader still. Seen from his radically perspectival position, all things are worthy of love: you, me, the fish swimming in the stream, the stream itself.\nLove all things without exception, for heaven and earth are one body.\nFurther Reading Books and articles I have used Brook Ziporyn\u0026rsquo;s translation: Zhuangzi: the essential writings with selections from traditional commentaries (Hackett 2009).\nThe translation from the Shuo Yuan is my own.

But for now, we\u0026rsquo;re going to plunge right in, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to try to figure out what Plato\u0026rsquo;s theory of forms is all about.\nMore or Less Ideal Cats One reason that Plato\u0026rsquo;s theory of forms can be hard to get hold of is that Plato never sits down and says, \u0026lsquo;Okay, I\u0026rsquo;m now going to tell you my theory of forms.\u0026rsquo; Instead, while he refers to these mysterious forms repeatedly, sometimes even discussing them at length, he never tells us exactly what he means.\nAs a result, in the centuries since Plato, philosophers have disagreed about the nuances of Plato\u0026rsquo;s theory. But most of them have agreed that his theory of forms is a way of thinking about the relationship between two things. On the one hand, there is the messy, untidy world that we access through our sense experience. And on the other hand, there is the world of ideals that we access through the intellect.\nBut to help us get to grips with this, let me start with a story. Here in Sofia, where I\u0026rsquo;m currently living, we recently fostered a cat. He was a handsome fellow, with long ginger hair and golden eyes. The rescue people called him Aslan, and as we were only short-term carers, we kept the name.\nBefore Alsan arrived, the rescue organisation told us he was the ideal cat—as close as a cat can be to being a paragon of perfection. He was friendly, he was well-behaved, and he was strikingly good-looking. And all this turned out to be true: once Alsan moved in, we were immediately smitten. Here he is, just for the record.\nSoon after Aslan settled in, the cat rescue people got in touch again. They were looking to rehome another cat. And they told us they had a plan. As Aslan was a particularly fine specimen, an almost-perfect cat, they said they would see if they could find an ugly companion cat to bond him with. Then they could rehome the two cats together. Ugly cats, they said, are harder to home; but if they come with beautiful companions, people are willing to take them in.\nThis seemed problematic in all kinds of ways. But we liked the idea of having an ugly cat in the household, so we agreed. When it came down to it, there were no ugly cats available. So, when cat number two turned up (he had been rescued from an aspen tree, and so was called Aspen), he was hardly a bad-looking character. He was sweet and not unattractive, and very friendly. But although we loved him and Aslan equally, it was also clear to us that Aslan was the more perfect of the two beasts—the closer to the ideal cat (if such a thing can be said to exist).\nThe two boys got on very well, and after a few more weeks living with us, they were transported to their new long-term home in Germany. And after they had gone, I was left with a philosophical question: what makes a cat more or less ideal, or more or less perfect? What do we even mean when we say this?\nFeline Forms The answers to these questions will lead us straight to Plato\u0026rsquo;s theory of forms. So let\u0026rsquo;s have a look at this little diagram depicting six cats (drawn by the late, great Elee Kirk). Imagine them numbered one to six, starting at the top left and ending at the bottom right.\nBefore we start discussing these cats in detail, it\u0026rsquo;s worth pausing to ask how we know that this is a picture of cats, and not of dogs or of lemurs or of members of parliament. One answer to this is that we know because these drawings correspond, to a greater or lesser degree, to the mental image we have of what a cat is.\nBut also, in looking at these cats, you may also have already decided that they are not all equal in their perfection. In fact, some are decidedly more perfect than others.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve used this picture when teaching a lot in the past, and I often ask my students to tell me which is the most perfect or most ideal cat. At this point, some people say, \u0026lsquo;I like no. 3\u0026rsquo; (the piratical cat with a missing eye). Or they say, \u0026lsquo;cat no. 4 is cute\u0026rsquo; (the lopsided one). And that\u0026rsquo;s fine. We might prefer these cats. But in saying that no. 4 is lopsided, or no. 3 is missing an eye, we\u0026rsquo;re also committing ourselves to the idea that the ideal cat is symmetrical, or has two eyes. Cat no. 3 and cat no. 4 may be cuter, but they are less perfect because they depart from the ideal.\nSo which is the most perfect cat? Here, most people equivocate between no. 1 and no. 2. After all, no. 5 is dead, which is something of an imperfection. And no. 6 is a bit cross-eyed, so also diverges from the idea we have in our minds of what it is to be a perfect cat.\nIn other words, when we come across cats in the world (or drawings of cats), we evaluate how ideal or perfect they are by comparing them with the idea (or, as Plato sometimes puts it, with the form) of what a perfect cat is. And this idea or form of a cat is not something we access with the senses. It is something we access with the mind.\nPerfect Forms and Imperfect Sandwiches In this way, Plato divides the world into more or less imperfect things that we apprehend through the senses, and perfect things (forms or ideas) that we apprehend through the intellect. It is a move that comes from his interest in mathematics. So let\u0026rsquo;s move from talking about cats to talking about triangles.\nA triangle, you will remember from school, is a mathematical object with three straight sides, the angles of which (assuming that it is on a plane) add up to 180 degrees. There are a few things to notice here.\nFirst, this is true by definition, which means it is also timelessly true. It is true independent of any actual triangles in the world. If the universe was reduced to a shapeless rubble—a fine dust without anything being obviously any shape at all—the truth of the definition of a triangle would still hold.\nSecond, the idea (or the form) of the triangle is not something we apprehend by seeing, but instead something we grasp by the power of the intellect. When we understand that a triangle is a three-sided polygon, we have grasped the essence of what a triangle is—not with our senses, but instead with our minds.\nAnd third, the various triangular things in the world we come across only at best approximate to this ideal definition of a triangle. These tasty-looking sandwiches, for example, are only approximately triangles.\nThe most real, most substantial triangle is not the sandwich in front of us. Instead, it is the triangle we can grasp with the mind. This is the eternal form (or idea) of the triangle, of which sandwiches, pyramids and other imperfect worldly things are only dim reflections.\nThe Form of the Good While Plato\u0026rsquo;s arguments from mathematics may seem pretty convincing, when it comes to particular things in the world like cats, the theory of forms becomes a bit harder to make sense of. Is there one form for black cats and another for ginger cats, or is there only one form for cats in general? Does Aslan (handsome fellow that he is) participate in the form for \u0026lsquo;cats\u0026rsquo;, or for \u0026lsquo;domestic cats\u0026rsquo; or for \u0026lsquo;mammals\u0026rsquo; or for \u0026lsquo;quadrupeds\u0026rsquo;, or for all of these? This was a question that Plato\u0026rsquo;s student Aristotle raised in his Metaphysics. Aristotle realised that when you start to pick away at the question of how many forms are there for any one thing, things rapidly become complicated.\nBut Plato was never really very interested in things like cats and dogs. He was much more interested in taking his insights from mathematics to tackle bigger, more pressing questions—like questions of ethics. And the thing he cared about above all else was what he called the form of the good (or, in Greek, ἡ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ ἰδέα).\nWhat is this mysterious \u0026lsquo;form of the good\u0026rsquo;? If we go back to Plato\u0026rsquo;s early dialogue, the Euthyphro, we find Socrates worrying about the subjects over which we human beings fall into dispute. If we fall out with each other, it is not because we disagree over things we can resolve by measurement, or through the evidence of the senses. If you say there are ten sandwiches on the plate, and I say there are eleven, then we can resolve our dispute amicably by counting the sandwiches.\nSo, what things do we fall out over? They are usually questions like these: What makes a good sandwich? Should tuna ever be allowed in a sandwich? Whom do these sandwiches belong to? By what right did you eat the sandwich I had put aside for my lunch? And so on. The questions we fall out over are questions about good and bad, justice and injustice.\nFrom the very early Platonic dialogues, Socrates roams around in a ceaseless quest to get to the heart of these kinds of questions. He asks what is justice?, or what is goodness? And in asking these kinds of questions, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t want just an example of just behaviour or of a good action. He wants to know the essence of justice. He wants to know the unchanging, eternal form of justice.\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s gamble is this: what, he wonders, there is such a thing as an ideal form of the good, one that we can access by means of the intellect—just as we can access the ideal form of a triangle by means of the intellect? If we could only get hold of that, then we could resolve our disputes with ease. And we could organise ourselves in perfect harmony. Goodness and justice would prevail. And many of our deepest human problems would be solved. Or at the very least, we would all behave a lot more sensibly.\n\u0026lsquo;This is how I see it,\u0026rsquo; Socrates says in the Republic (VII 517 b-c):\nIn the knowable realm, the form of the good is the last thing to be seen, and it is reached only with difficulty. Once one has seen it, however, one must conclude that it is the cause of all that is correct and beautiful in anything, that it produces both light and its source in the visible realm, and that in the intelligible realm it controls and provides truth and understanding, so that anyone who is to act sensibly in private or public must see it.\nFurther Reading There\u0026rsquo;s so much more that could be said about Plato\u0026rsquo;s forms. This is a tricky area of Plato\u0026rsquo;s philosophy (what area of philosophy isn\u0026rsquo;t tricky?), and there\u0026rsquo;s a risk that everything you say about it going to be either wrong, or only partially true, or at least contentious. But the following books and links will give you a way into some of the debates.\nBooks and articles Julia Annas\u0026rsquo;s Plato, A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2003) is a nice introduction.\nQuite a few academic publishers have handy \u0026lsquo;companion to Plato\u0026rsquo; volumes. The Continuum Companion to Plato edited by Gerald A. Press (Continuum 2012) has a nice, easy introduction to Plato\u0026rsquo;s theory of forms.\nThere are lots of translations of Plato available. He\u0026rsquo;s a surprisingly readable writer (even if the twists and turns of argument can be sometimes hard to follow). I usually use Plato: Complete Works edited by D. H. Hutchinson (Hackett 1997)\nOnline Resources Have a read of this piece about the form of the good on 1000 word philosophy.\n",

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Like Confucius and Mencius before him, it is said that the Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang, or Xunzi (c. 310 – 235 BCE), was an itinerant advisor to kings and rulers.\nNot much is known about his early life. But there are indications that in his later years as a political advisor, he had more success than both Mencius and Confucius. He was appointed to several high positions, before eventually retiring from public life and living out the remainder of his years far from the intrigues of politics.\nA book to encourage virtue What we know about Xunzi\u0026rsquo;s thinking comes from a book that is usually referred to as \u0026rsquo;the Xunzi\u0026rsquo;, a book that now consists of thirty-two chapters. The Xunzi was compiled in the first century BCE by the librarian Liu Xiang, long after the death of Xun Kuang.\nThe book covers a huge range of topics: everything from ritual to Confucius, to self-cultivation, to a series of catchy and rather high-minded songs referred to as \u0026lsquo;working songs\u0026rsquo; — songs that, apparently, were designed to be memorable enough to sing whilst working, to help encourage their singers to virtue.\nAs a collection of texts, the Xunzi is incredibly rich. These texts may not all have been written by Xunzi, and some parts may be written by later thinkers. But taken as a whole, the Xunzi does present a coherent set of concerns. And it is particularly famous for its exploration of human nature.\nPhilosophy Xunzi is often contrasted with Mencius. But for all their differences, these two Confucian philosophers share a good deal: they are both concerned with human nature; they are both worried about how to establish a stable, functional society; and they are both preoccupied with things like justice or yi, fellow-feeling or ren, and ritual or li.\nHowever, in thinking-through how to attain the end of a stable society, Xunzi came to very different conclusions from the more sunny-natured Mencius. Mencius built his philosophy on claims about the goodness of human nature. In contrast to this, Xunzi argues that \u0026lsquo;The nature of human beings is bad; goodness is artificial.\u0026rsquo; Or, as Nick Cave once put it: \u0026lsquo;People ain\u0026rsquo;t no good.\u0026rsquo;\nTaming our badness Xunzi\u0026rsquo;s objection to Mencius is relatively simple. He says that Mencius\u0026rsquo;s claims about the goodness of human nature simply don\u0026rsquo;t correspond with our experience of the world.\nMencius says: people’s nature is good. Nothing conforms to his distinctions, and this does not match the test of experience. He sits and propounds it, but when he stands up then he cannot implement it, and when he unfolds it then he cannot put it into practice. Is his error not great indeed!Thus, if human nature is good, then one may do away with the sage kings and put ritual and yi [justice] to rest. If human nature is bad, then one simply must side with the sage kings and honor ritual and justice. [1]\nXunzi thinks it is reckless of Mencius to emphasise the goodness of human nature because in doing so, we risk underestimating the strength of our own selfish desires.\nIf we start from the idea that human nature is bad, on the other hand, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to fall into this trap. We\u0026rsquo;re going to set about urgently trying to cultivate goodness, rather than complacently thinking we are already good.\nCrafting ourselves To say that human nature is bad is not a counsel of despair. Instead, it is a call to action. Human nature may be bad, but it can be refashioned.\nHere, Xunzi takes his metaphors from the works of craftspeople and uses images of crooked trees that will already be familiar if you have read about Zhuangzi. For the Daoist philosopher Zhuangzi, crookedness was something to be embraced, on the principle that the crooked trees are the ones that are not cut down.\nFor Xunzi, on the other hand, crookedness is a challenge. However crooked we are, for Xunzi, with sufficient art and skill, we can be straightened out.\nThus, the press frame originated because of crooked wood. The ink-line arose because of things that are not straight. Lords and superiors were established and ritual and justice were made clear because of the fact that human nature is bad.Looking at it in this way, it is clear that people’s nature is bad, and that their goodness is a matter of deliberate effort. Straight wood does not await the press frame in order to become straight, because its nature is to be straight. Crooked wood must await the press frame and steaming and bending and only then will it be straight, because it is by nature not straight. [2]\nIf you know your 18th-century philosophy, this may bring to mind the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who once wrote that \u0026rsquo;nothing entirely straight can be fashioned from the crooked wood of which humankind is made.\u0026rsquo;\nFor both Kant and Xunzi, there\u0026rsquo;s something about human beings that is fundamentally out of shape, that doesn\u0026rsquo;t sit comfortably. But although they use the same metaphors, Xunzi is arguably more optimistic, because he claims that ultimately our crooked timber can in fact be made straight. We can make something good and true out of this crooked wood: and the tools by means of which we do this are ritual and justice.\nThe beauty of goodness The challenge, then, is how to reshape ourselves. In saying that human nature is bad and that goodness is artificial, Xunzi isn\u0026rsquo;t giving up on goodness. Instead, he is saying that goodness is an artefact created through human effort; and this artificiality is what makes it worthwhile.\nSometimes Xunzi is criticised for being harsh. And he is certainly a more austere philosopher than Mencius. But it would be unfair to present him as simply as a philosopher who just wants to give us a hard time or to make us feel bad about ourselves. Instead, in arguing that we are bad by nature, he wants to push us towards living better, more beautiful lives.\nXunzi argues that it is only when we recognise we lack something that we can desire to have the thing we lack. If we are ugly, we desire to be beautiful. If we are poor, we desire to be rich. If our experience is narrow, we desire it to be broader. So it is precisely in recognising our badness that we can see the desirability of goodness.\nThis leads Xunzi to the seeming paradox: \u0026lsquo;people desire to become good because their nature is bad.\u0026rsquo; This is an interesting psychological insight. We might assume that people behave badly because they like behaving badly. But perhaps for most of us, when we behave badly, we want to be better—we just don\u0026rsquo;t know how.\nRefashioning our timber This means there\u0026rsquo;s something optimistic about Xunzi. With enough artifice, he tells us, even our crooked selves can be made good.\nSo what kind of artifice do we need? For Xunzi, one of the most important kinds of artifice is education. Chapter one of the Xunzi is called An Exhortation to Learning begins like this:\nLearning must never stop. Blue dye derives from the indigo plant, and yet it is bluer than the plant. Ice comes from water, and yet it is colder than water. Through steaming and bending, you can make wood as straight as an ink-line into a wheel\u0026hellip; The noble person learns broadly and examines themeslves thrice daily, and then their knowledge is clear and their conduct without fault. [3]\nThis is not just an individual pursuit of learning, but a social one. Like Confucius before him, Xunzi sees human beings as essentially social creatures. What we really need to do is to seek out those who have managed to refashion themselves, and hang out with them.\nWe need wise teachers who know what it means to refashion their lives. We need friends who have struggled hard to develop positive qualities. And we need people who have cultivated goodness in themselves. Because if we practice hard enough in the company of others, if we understand the transforming power of ritual, if we \u0026lsquo;ponder, query and thoroughly investigate\u0026rsquo;, then Xunzi tells us that moral perfection is within our reach.\nBeing perfectly good is hard. But it is perfectly possible.\nNotes [1] Eric L. Hutton, Xunzi: The Complete Text (Princeton University Press 2014), p 142\n[2] ibid, p. 142\n[3] ibid, p. 1.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "The Aztecs and Philosophy Who were the Aztecs? The people now usually called the Aztecs were a Nahuatl-speaking people from Central Mexico. From the thirteenth century, their ancestors migrated from what is now Northern Mexico and the Southern United States to Mexico\u0026rsquo;s high central plateau. In the long political struggle for dominance that followed, the Aztecs eventually settled on a marshy, unprepossessing island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, where they began to build up a regional power base that became the foundation of one of the world\u0026rsquo;s greatest empires.\nBy 1519, when Hernán Cortés and his colonial Spanish army turned up at the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the island city counted as one of the world\u0026rsquo;s largest, and was roughly four times the size of London. [1] But the arrival of the colonial powers was ruinous for Aztec culture. Cortés exploited internal disputes and divisions and formed a coalition of forces that laid siege to Tenochtitlan. And with the newly introduced horror of smallpox ravaging the population, within two years, the greatest city of the Aztecs had surrendered.\nNezahualcoyotl, the Aztec philosopher-king Perhaps one of the greatest Aztec philosophers of the pre-colonial era was Nezahualcoyotl (1429-1472), whose name literally means “the coyote with a collar of fasting.” The collar of fasting, or nezahualli, was a braided collar worn by those undertaking a fast, as in indication they should not be offered food.\nNezahualcoyotl was a military general, a poet, a lawmaker, and a _tlamatinime _ (literally “one who knows”, __ or a sage).\nMuch of his philosophy was expressed in poetry that reflected on the brevity of human life. Here is an example:\nI, Nezahualcoyotl, ask this:Is it true one really lives on the earth?Not forever on earth,only a little while here.Though it be jade it falls apart,though it be gold it wears away,though it be quetzal plumage it is torn asunder.Not forever on earth,only a little while here. [2]\nNezahualcoyotl was by all accounts a brutal ruler. But he was also a cultural reformer. He was a patron of the arts, and the force behind the development of the city of Tenochtitlan to its cultural heights. It is in part thanks to Nezahualcoyotl that, when the Spaniards arrived and saw the architectural marvels of Tenochtitlan, they were so astonished they apparently asked each other whether they were dreaming.\nPhilosophy The poetry of Nezahualcoyotl has a keen sense of the transience and instability of the world. But this is not just a poet\u0026rsquo;s personal vision of life. Instead, it is a reflection of a much deeper philosophical view of life, one that was at the heart of Aztec culture and society.\nFinding a footing At the root of the Aztec understanding of human life is the idea that the world we inhabit, and our place in it, are both radically unstable. According to a common Nahuatl saying, “It is slippery, it is slick on the earth” (or in Nahuatl, “Tlaalahui, tlapetzcahui in tlalticpac”) [3]. When making our way through the world, it is as if we are navigating a high-up pathway that is slick with mud. Life is a dangerous itinerary, a pathway along which we always risk losing our footing.\nThis slipperiness, in the Aztec understanding, is the fundamental condition of the world. It is not just that the world is slippery for us; it is also slippery in itself. And the art of living is the art of maintaining a balance amid all this slipperiness.\nIn this understanding, it is all too easy to lose our balance and to fall into either moral wrongdoing or misfortune. And this is why we need wisdom: because wisdom is nothing other than learning what it means to maintain our balance.\nThis does not imply that the world is unremittingly awful: there is room for pleasure, for shared enjoyment of the world. But without vigilance and an appreciation of the changeable nature of the world, in the Aztec understanding, we will not thrive for long.\nTeotl and becoming Within Aztec thought, the underlying principle of everything is a single force or power called teotl. You could see teotl as a self-generating force or energy that is also the underlying stuff that makes up all reality. This energy is not personal—it is not God, even if it underpins the possibility of the existence of gods—nor is it an agent. It is sacred, meaning that the universe as a whole is also sacred, but it is impersonal.\nThe idea of teotl makes processes of change and flow fundamental to the world. In this view, the cosmos as a whole is self-generating and self-renewing. And the dynamism of teotl is why the world itself is such a slippery, uncertain and changeable thing. [4] It might be better to think about teotl not so much as a thing as a process. Or else, it can be useful to think—as James Maffie writes in his article on the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy—not so much of teotl as teotl-ising.\nMotion-change This idea of teotl gave Aztec thinkers an extraordinary sensitivity to the different kinds of change that take place in the world.\nJames Maffie talks about motion-change as a way of describing the different processes in this teotlising world. For the Aztec thinkers, there are three kinds of motion-change: olin, malinalli and nepantla. Olin is change that is repetitive, that pulsates and stretches and oscillates. It is, Maffie writes,\ncurving, swaying, oscillating, pulsating, and centering motion-change. It is exemplified by bouncing balls, pulsating hearts, respiring chests, earthquakes, labor contractions\u0026hellip; [5]\nOlin is all about equivocation, about coming-and-going. It is the bouncing of a ball. Or it is a pendulum swinging between extremes. It is the uncertainty we have when we are not sure what to do with ourselves. It is our gasping for breath when we have been for a run. And it is the struggle we have to find our equilibrium when the world is slippery.\nIn contrast to olin, malinalli is a kind of change that coils and binds and circles and whirls. It is the twisting together of threads to make ropes, the way that disparate-seeming things are bound together. It is,\ntwisting, spinning, gyrating, coiling, whirling, and spiraling motion-change. It is exemplified by spinning fiber into thread, cooking and digesting food, blowing life into things, drilling fire, burning incense, and ritual music, speech, and song. [6]\nIf we spin words and tunes into song, if we take this slippery material of the world and shape it and fashion it, then this is malinalli. The braided “fasting collar” or nezahualli from which Nezahualcoyotl took his name could also be seen as being fashioned by means of malinalli motion-change.\nBut the final—and most fundamental—kind of motion-change is nepantla. Again, Maffie writes,\nNepantla is middling, intermixing, and mutually reciprocating motion-change. It binds together\u0026hellip; Nepantla motion-change is exemplified by mixing and shaking things together, weaving (interlacing), and sexual commingling. [7]\nNepantla is about how the world is woven together, how things are brought together and thereby transformed in new patterns and configurations. It is the constant generation and regeneration of an ordered fabric from this changeable cosmos.\nWeaving the world Within Aztec thought, although the world is inherently slippery, and there is an always-present risk of falling from the path, we are not therefore at the mercy of things. If we can understand these processes of change—olin, malinalli and nepantla—and if we can become a tlamatinime or a sage, we can manage to navigate the world and maintain a degree of balance.\nFor the thinkers of the Aztec world, wisdom is eminently practical: it is not about sitting back and contemplating the world. After all, how can you sit back and contemplate, when the world is so slippery that the moment you relax your guard, you are likely to fall from the path?\nInstead, for the philosophers of the Aztec world, wisdom is about learning what it means to live in this pulsating, gyrating, twisting, spinning, intermixing cosmos. It means understanding more deeply the complexity of a changing cosmos that is teotl, to open up creative possibilities for how we go about our lives. When we can find our balance like this, then we can participate in the ongoing creativity of the universe, the ongoing weaving of the world-in-motion that is teotl. Again, James Maffie writes,\nIn the final analysis, teotl is simultaneously the weaver of reality, the weaving of reality, and woven reality itself. [8]\nIt takes skill and knowledge to come to terms with these processes of change. But when we have sufficient wisdom to really see the world\u0026rsquo;s instability and ambiguity, then we can work with it to weave a well-balanced life.\nNotes [1] There\u0026rsquo;s an excellent overview of the early history of the Aztecs in David Carrasco\u0026rsquo;s The Aztecs, A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2012).\n[2] Miguel León-Portilla, Fifteen Poets of the Aztec World (Oklahoma University Press 1992), p.70\n[3] The translation comes from Louise Burkhart, The Slippery Earth: Nahua-Christian Dialogue in Sixteenth-Century Mexico (University of Arizona Press 1989).\n[4] James Maffie\u0026rsquo;s Aztec Philosophy: Understanding a World in Motion (University Press of Colorado 2014) gives a very detailed exploration of teotl and its role in Aztec metaphysics.\n[5] Aztec Philosophy, p. 13\n[6] ibid. p. 14\n[7] ibid.\n[8] ibid. p. 513\nFurther Reading Books Robert Eli Sanchez Jr\u0026rsquo;s Latin American and Latinx Philosophy: A Collaborative Introduction (Routledge 2020) is a good introduction.\nMiguel León-Portilla\u0026rsquo;s Aztec Thought and Culture (Oklahoma University Press 2012) is also worth a read.\nOnline Resources James Maffie\u0026rsquo;s excellent article on the IEP is well worth reading.\nLynn Sebastian Purcell\u0026rsquo;s blog from the APA is a beautifully clear introduction to some themes in Aztec philosophy.

            "content": "Zhuangzi: The Philosopher and the Text Zhuangzi (sometimes written Chuang Tzu), or Master Zhuang, is the name given to the philosopher Zhuang Zhou, who lived in China sometime between 369 and 286 BCE. The book that takes the philosopher\u0026rsquo;s name, the Zhuangzi, is almost certainly the work of several hands. And although the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t present a coherent viewpoint, it does have an overarching mood: a free-wheeling, almost anarchistic blend of humour and insight, one that may reflect the character of the historical Zhuang Zhou.\nDragging our tails in the mud As with many early philosophers, Zhuangzi is a somewhat shadowy figure. What scraps of biography we have are fragmentary and unreliable.\nZhuang Zhou\u0026rsquo;s name appears in the work of the historian Sima Qian, who lived between 145 and 86 BCE. Sima Qian wrote that Zhuang Zhou was from the state of Song, and he had a low-ranking official position. One particularly famous story from Sima Qian tells of how one day, Zhuangzi is invited to become prime minister of the State of Chu. But he declines, likening a government official to a sacrificial ox that is dressed up in finery, well-fed and well-treated… until the day comes that it is inevitably sacrificed.\nA similar story appears in the Zhuangzi itself. In this story, the philosopher was once idling by the side of the river Pu, catching fish. As he was fishing, two envoys from the King of Chu approached him. The King had heard Zhuang Zhou was a wise man, and so had sent the envoys to invite him to become prime minister.\nThe envoys imagined Zhuang Zhou would be delighted by his promotion from humble fisherman to most powerful minister in the realm. But the philosopher was not impressed. He didn\u0026rsquo;t even look around but went on fishing. Then he said to the two envoys:\nI have heard there is a sacred turtle in Chu, already dead for three thousand years, which the king keeps in a bamboo chest high in his shrine. Do you think this turtle would prefer to be dead and having his carcass exalted or alive and dragging his backside through the mud? [1]\nThe envoys confessed that the tortoise lurking in the mud was probably having the better time of it. Still not turning around, Zhuang Zhou told them to scram. “Get out of here,” he said. “I, too, will drag my backside through the mud!”\nPhilosophy On gnarliness and uselessness It\u0026rsquo;s already apparent that the Zhuang Zhou in these stories is a thinker who is sceptical about the idea that prestige and social status are a path to the good life. And the text of the Zhuangzi tackles these questions more directly, putting forward an intriguing argument about the inherent value of uselessness.\nOne image that crops up repeatedly in the text, in various forms, is the image of the gnarled, ancient tree that is so twisted and bent out of shape that nobody ever tries to cut it down. Here is one version of the story as it appears in the text:\nZiqi of Nanbo was travelling in the hills of Shang when he came across a huge tree. He marvelled at it, for the horses from a thousand chariots could have cooled themselves in its shade. “What sort of tree is this?” said Ziqi. “It must be of unusually fine material.” Looking up at its branches, he saw that they were too twisted and gnarled to be used for beams or pillars. Looking down at its trunk, he saw that it was too splotched and split to be used for a coffin. It stung and stabbed the tongue when licked and crazed and inebriated the mind for three days when sniffed. Ziqi said, “It turns out to be a worthless tree, and thus it has been able to grow so huge\u0026hellip;\u0026quot; [2]\nThen Ziqi sighs, and says, “Ah! People of spirit depend on this uselessness!”\nThe argument is this: useful trees, and useful people, are liable to be chopped down. Making ourselves useful simply puts us in the way of danger, just like the government minister who bustles around being useful, only to be cast aside (or, worse, executed) when it no longer seems expedient for them to continue in their role. Our concern with usefulness brings with it significant risks and problems (see also Yang Zhu, and Arete the Cyrenaic).\nAfter talking about several large, gnarled and useless trees, the Zhuangzi switches to the human world. Here the author tells the story of a man he calls Shu the Discombobulated. Shu is so profoundly disabled that he is passed over for military service, and exempted by rulers when it comes to engaging in forced labour. In this way, Shu manages to live out his natural lifespan, while his able-bodied compatriots risk, and often lose, their lives.\nContemporary philosophers John Altmann and Bryan W. Van Norden have suggested that Zhuangzi is the first philosopher of disability, because he challenges our narrowly preconceived notions of human norms, and asks us to re-evaluate our ideas about what is most desirable in human life.\nZhuangzi concludes his discussion of uselessness with the famous claim that to really understand what is important in life, we need to undertake a revolution in what we value and take to be good and useful.\nEveryone knows how useful usefulness is, but no one seems to know how useful uselessness is. [3]\nFree and easy rambling The freewheeling philosophical style of the Zhuangzi is captured by the phrase “free and easy wandering” (xiaoyao you), which is also the title of the opening section of the text.\nThe Zhuangzi takes this idea of free and easy wandering not only as an idea to think about philosophically but also as advice for how to do philosophy. The text is endlessly digressive, always liable to go off on all kinds of strange tangents. One moment, the author is talking about an enormous mythical fish called Kun, thousands of miles long. Next, he is talking about an obscure ancient joke book. Then he is spinning parables about cicadas and doves. After that, he is reflecting on questions of identity and merit.\nSo this idea of free wandering really captures something of the spirit of the Zhuangzi\u0026rsquo;s philosophy as a whole, and reminds us that if we want to stumble across interesting new ideas, then the way to do this is often to wander freely, rather than to follow a more defined line of research.\nYou could say that for Zhuangzi, or for the authors of the Zhuangzi, what is most important—in philosophy and life—is that we can keep on moving, that we maintain this free and easy wandering. And this free and easy wandering is a path toward true security, because it allows us to connect harmoniously with the many transformations of the world, rather than being at odds with them.\nThis is how the Zhuangzi puts it:\nHarmonize with all things by means of their Heavenly Transitions, follow along with them in their limitless overflowings, and you will be able to fully live out your years. Forget what year it is, forget what should or should not be. Let yourself be jostled and shaken by the boundlessness—for that is how to be lodged securely in the boundlessness!” [4]\nThe Zhuangzi is hugely entertaining read. But it is also a challenging one, because it asks us to really question whether the things we consider to be good, worthwhile or valuable are in reality as good, worthwhile or valuable as we imagine them to be. And it challenges us to ask: what if things only start happening for us only when we learn how to more effectively bunk off? What if our plans for how to make our lives useful are simply a way of cutting ourselves off from the experience of living more deeply and boundlessly? And what if it is only when we forget ourselves—and all our ideas of what is important—that we can really understand what life is all about?\nNotes [1] Brook Ziporyn, Zhuangzi: The Essential Writings with Selections from Traditional Commentaries (Hackett 2009), p. 67\n[2] ibid. p. 33\n[3] ibid. p. 33\n[4] ibid, p. 24, translation slightly modified\nFurther Reading Books I used Brook Ziporyn\u0026rsquo;s translation for this piece, but if you can track down Victor Mair\u0026rsquo;s Wandering on the Way: Early Taoist Tales and Parables of Chuang Tzu (Bantam Books 1994), it\u0026rsquo;s a really enjoyable read.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Arete of Cyrene was born into a philosophically-inclined family. Her father, Aristippus of Cyrene (c. 430 – 356 BCE), founded a distinctive philosophical school, known as the Cyrenaics, named after his home town, near Shahhat in present-day Libya.\nWe know slightly more about Aristippus than we do about his daughter Arete. He travelled to Athens when he was still a young man, and he became a part of the circle surrounding Socrates, although they had very different philosophical approaches. After the death of Socrates, Aristippus left Athens to travel: to Corinth, Aegina, Megara and Lydia, in present-day Turkey. He eventually returned to Cyrene.\nIt is not clear at which point in this itinerant wandering Arete was born. But we do know that Aristippus taught her philosophy. According to Diogenes Laërtius:\nAristippus \u0026ldquo;shared his training” (sunaskōn); he taught Arete “to be disdainful of excess” (huperoptikēn tou pleionos einai). [1]\nAfter her father\u0026rsquo;s death in Cyrene, Arete took over as head of his philosophical school. Later, she passed on the school\u0026rsquo;s teachings to her son, also called Aristippus.\nSkipped generations and invisible women In many written histories of the Cyrenaic school, Aristippus senior is presented as the founder of the tradition, and Aristippus junior as the systematiser of Cyrenaic doctrines. In between, Arete seems to mysteriously disappear into the background, as if the philosophical gene somehow skips a generation. But when you look closer, it becomes apparent that she had a much larger role in the shaping and transmission of Cyrenaic thought than some later commentators have credited her with.\nThe extant records suggest that Aristippus Senior\u0026rsquo;s philosophy was somewhat unsystematic and freewheeling. It is only with Aristippus Junior that things become more firmed-up. But there is reason to think that Arete may have had a significant influence on systematising Cyrenaic doctrine. The fact that she is referred to in the texts as Aristippus\u0026rsquo;s successor suggests she was important to the tradition philosophically. And throughout antiquity, Aristippus junior was frequently referred to as being metrodidactus, or “mother-taught”, in acknowledgement of her significance. If the Cyrenaic school was something of a family business, at the heart of this business, and this lineage, was Arete.\nPhilosophy Although largely forgotten in the later philosophical tradition, the Cyrenaics were an important philosophical school in the Ancient Greek world. They emphasised hedonism and the importance of attending to the needs of the body. But this emphasis on pleasure was not arbitrary. Instead, it was based on a deeper claim about what we can truly know.\nIndeterminacy and affection For the Cyrenaics, the search to find out how things are in themselves — a search that goes back to Thales — is doomed to failure. Things in themselves are indeterminate, ungraspable.\nBut why should they be so difficult to grasp? According to some readings of Cyrenaic philosophy, things are not ungraspable because of our deficiencies. They are ungraspable because things in themselves are not really things at all, at least in the sense that we apprehend them as things, but are something altogether more undifferentiated, indeterminate and entangled (here there might be a comparison with Anaxagoras and his gunk). We experience the universe as being made up of determinate objects. But when you dig down, these objects don\u0026rsquo;t have any fixed, determinate essence. For a contemporary analogy, think how the closer you look at things, the more the everyday objects of our experience dissolve into a fizz of subatomic particles.\nThe Cyrenaics claim that we can\u0026rsquo;t know how things are in any ultimate sense. So why bother trying? Instead of seeking out how things are, we should focus instead on how things affect us. The job of philosophy is not to dig down and find the true nature of things. Instead, it is to explore how to live well in the light of the fact that although things may be indeterminate, they nevertheless affect us. The big philosophical task is to explore the nature of the affections, and to thereby manage what it means to be a living, fleshy, feelingful creature.\nPolitics and pleasure This leads the Cyrenaics to a scepticism about the value of political engagement. We might think that political engagement is a good and necessary thing. But more often than not, our political entanglements cause us harm and distress. Seen from the point of view of big, grand-seeming things like \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo;, political engagement may seem necessary. But when we ask \u0026ldquo;how does political engagement affect us?\u0026rdquo;, it seems much less desirable.\nIn his Memorabilia, Xenophon tells a story of an encounter between the young Aristippus and Socrates. Aristippus says to Socrates:\nin no way at all do I put myself in the order of those who wish to rule. In fact, in my opinion, it is quite senseless that it not be enough for a human being to furnish himself with what he needs, although this is a lot of work, but instead to take on the additional task of procuring also for the rest of the citizens what they need. And, while doing without many of the things he wishes for himself, after having presided over the city he undergoes a penalty unless he accomplishes everything the city wishes. How is this not great senselessness? [2]\nSeeking political office is a risky business. It goes beyond meeting the needs of the body and puts us in the way of danger. Here, the Cyrenaics seem close to the philosophy of Yang Zhu over in China, who also argued that seeking the status of political office is both exhausting and risky. We are much better off living out our lives by cultivating bodily pleasure and avoiding, as far as is possible, bodily pain.\nThe smooth motion of the flesh But what are pleasure and pain? For the Cyrenaics, pleasure is “the smooth motion of the flesh,” whilst pain is “a rough motion” in the flesh. Here is what Diogenes Laërtius says about the Cyrenaics:\nThey posited two experiences, bodily pain and pleasure, one a smooth motion, pleasure, and pain a rough motion. One pleasure does not differ from another, nor is anything particularly pleasant. Pleasure is good-seeming to all animals, and pain is repulsive. [3]\nBoth pleasure and pain are about motion. The Cyrenaics see our bodies as living, dynamic things: and motion is central to what it means to be embodied. This is not just about how we move through the world, but about understanding our body as a dynamic, living thing. Our breath comes and goes. Our blood pumps through our veins. This living motion of the body can be either uncomfortable, disharmonious, and rough; or it can be comfortable, harmonious, and smooth. The art of living is the art of cultivating this smooth motion of the flesh, giving rise to bodily ease, pleasure, comfort, and well-being.\nThere is something about the Cyrenaic search for pleasure that roots us firmly in our animal nature, as Diogenes Laërtius points out. And this capacity for pleasure is shared by other species. There is no more vivid image of the smooth motion of the flesh than that of a cat stretching and purring in the sun, immersed in the pleasure of being alive.\nAgainst excess and austerity You might think that this focus on pleasure is a recipe for excess. But it isn\u0026rsquo;t. Remember that Aristippus Senior taught Arete to be disdainful of excess. So how does this square with the idea of pleasure as central to human life?\nThe point here seems to be that the pursuit of distant pleasure is fruitless. Instead, we should seek pleasures that are close-by or proximate, or seek out the pleasures in the situation in which we currently find ourselves.\nAristippus enjoyed the pleasure of what was present, and didn’t hunt painfully after the enjoyment of what was not present.” [4]\nAccording to the Cyrenaics, the good life is a life free of both the search for excess and the search for austerity. Instead, it is a life where we attend to bodily pleasure here and now, adapting ourselves to our present circumstances, seeking to support the smooth motion of the flesh, recognising that this is the pinnacle of well-being.\nYou may disagree with this view of the good life. But I have consulted Margaret, the Looking for Wisdom office cat, and she thinks it all makes perfect sense…\nNotes Kurt Lampe, The Birth of Hedonism: The Cyrenaic Philosophers and Pleasure as a Way of Life (Princeton University Press 2015), p 39 Xenophon, translated Amy L.

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "Welcome to the final piece in our season three series on the philosophy of work. Over the last couple of months, we\u0026rsquo;ve been putting work under the philosophical microscope, and exploring why it plays such an important part in our lives.\nIn this final article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to go back over the territory we have covered, to see if we can now throw more light on the complex roles played by work in human life. And then we\u0026rsquo;re going to ask some questions about the future of work.\nFundamentals We started out by looking at what work is, and where it comes from. At a fundamental level, work is about acting on the world so that it meets our necessities — or beyond mere necessities, so that it accords more closely with our desires. This means that work is always tied up with the idea of the future. We work because are concerned with what will happen tomorrow (or next week, or next month, or next year, or ten years down the line).\nIn the jargon of the philosophers, one reason we work is because work brings us various external goods — various good or desirable things like food on the table, or clean drinking water. But work also involves internal goods: perhaps it gives us satisfaction, or meets a need we have to feel part of a community, and so on. But whether we are talking about external or internal goods, work has a future-facing aspect: we care about food, about status, about being liked and so on not just in the immediate term, but also because we want to secure our existence in the longer term.\nHowever, our present-day concerns with work are relatively new to human life. We saw in the first article how our ancestors may have had a very different relationship with work. For much of the human past, work was a more sporadic thing. And the history of our present ways of thinking about work can be traced back to the dawn of agriculture, where we can see the beginnings of the complicated relationship between work, hierarchy and the division of labour.\nThis relationship can also be seen in the early philosophical traditions of both Greece and China. The philosophers Aristotle and Mencius, for example, both saw hierarchy and the division of labour as essential to the functioning of society.\nLabour, Work and Action But \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; can refer to many kinds of activities. So in an attempt to give our discussion of work a more nuanced philosophical underpinning, in the second piece, we dived into the work of Hannah Arendt, and into her account of the vita activa, or the \u0026ldquo;active life.\u0026rdquo;\nYou can divide the things human beings do into two broad categories—doing stuff and thinking about stuff, or activity and contemplation. For Aristotle, the highest kind of life was the life of contemplation. Thinking about stuff was, to put it bluntly, better than doing stuff. In the 19th Century, Karl Marx reversed this hierarchy, arguing that contemplation, in isolation from actively intervening in the world, was largely useless. The point isn\u0026rsquo;t to just sit and think about the world, but instead to change it.\nArendt attempts to arbitrate in this squabble between thinkers and doers. For Arendt, both of these things matter: she wants to see human life whole. She cares deeply about the vita contemplativa, or the life of contemplation. But she also cares about the vita activa, the life of activity. A complete account of human life should encompass both contemplation and action.\nArendt\u0026rsquo;s book, The Human Condition, is about the vita activa (later on in her life, she started to work on a book about the vita contemplativa, to be called The Life of the Mind, but the book was unfinished on her death).\nIn The Human Condition, Arendt divides the life of activity into three. Labour is about meeting our basic needs. It is the unending and circular activity of attending to the things that we need for survival. In labour, Arendt argues, we are unfree, because we are bound to these fundamental biological needs. Work is about creating new things in the world that give us a degree of freedom (tables, chairs, houses, cunning irrigation systems, apps). And the third kind of activity Arendt calls action. This is about intervening in the order of our shared world to transform the structures of which we are a part. Action is about creatively reimagining our shared world, and it is where we are at our most free.\nThere are overlaps between all three kinds of activity, but it is a useful way of thinking about the role of work in our lives. Some of what we are doing when we are \u0026ldquo;working\u0026rdquo; is labouring to meet our needs. Some is trying to creatively reimagine our shared world. And some of what we are doing is creating new things that might help give us a degree of freedom within the constraints of the world to which we belong.\nWork as a Virtue In the third piece, we moved on to the idea that there is something inherently good about work. There are obviously many ways in which work can be good and useful. It can bring us all kinds of internal and external goods. It can help us meet our needs. It can be a way of producing useful stuff. And it can help us refashion our shared world. But in this class, we asked the question: is there something about work, simply by virtue of it being work, that makes it good and virtuous?\nSo in this article, we looked at the long tradition that sees work as a path to virtue, or—even more than this—as a path to our salvation. And we explored that idea that work is, as Thomas Carlyle suggested, a \u0026ldquo;purifying fire\u0026rdquo; that can help burn up all of our afflictions and our woes.\nAristotle thought that work was a mug\u0026rsquo;s game, and that no self-respecting philosopher should be found working. But an increasingly strident tradition of Western thought stressed the spiritual value of work. One early proponent of this idea was the monk Benedict of Nursia, for whom work was a necessary part of the monastic vocation, and idleness one of the greatest spiritual risks. But we also saw how, after the Reformation, there was a universalisation of the idea of vocation. And this contributed to the coming of what is often referred to as the \u0026ldquo;Protestant work ethic\u0026rdquo;—the ethical and spiritual demand that we should work as a way of cultivating virtue; and the idea that we should all live as if our work was a vocation, and this vocation was the road to our salvation.\nThe Badness of Work And yet, for all those who say that work is our salvation, there are others who claim that work is something we\u0026rsquo;d be better off without. In the fourth article, we looked at the spiritual damage caused by work. And we focussed in on three kinds of harm: the harms of overwork, the harms of what David Graeber has called \u0026ldquo;bullshit jobs\u0026rdquo;, and the harms of unemployment.\nThe harms of overwork are well documented. In exploring these harms, we also looked at how we might mitigate them. Here we saw some insights from the Daoist tradition on how we can optimally minimise work.\nBut work harms us in other, more subtle ways. Part of what makes work valuable for us is that we are beings who want to have an effect on the world. A meaningful life is one in which we actively shape the world of which we are a part. And this is what makes Graeber\u0026rsquo;s so-called \u0026ldquo;bullshit jobs\u0026rdquo; so damaging: they are jobs that do not feed this need we have to shape and remake the world. They are jobs that, however well-rewarded they may be, are overwhelming in their futility.\nFinally, we looked at unemployment. Many of the arguments in favour of work argue on the basis that unemployment is clearly bad for us. But unemployment, like work, can mean many things, and only some kinds of unemployment may be harmful to our flourishing. So we also explored the idea of whether there might be \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; kinds of unemployment, just as there are \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; kinds of work. And we asked what it would be to rethink our cultures of work so that both work and unemployment were conducive to human flourishing.\nIdleness and Play Having explored the benefits and harms of work, we changed tack to ask about some of those things that we consider to be \u0026ldquo;non-work\u0026rdquo;. Like everything else, we understand work partly in terms of what it is not. So we explored two kinds of non-work in more depth: idleness and play.\nIdleness is different from rest. When we are resting, we are not working so that we can return to work with a renewed energy. Rest is non-work for the sake of work. But idleness is a kind of non-work that isn\u0026rsquo;t defined by work at all. This is why Benedict of Nursia saw idleness as a gateway of vice and sin. But for precisely this reason, thinking through idleness might be a way of reimagining our lives, by stepping outside the ways in which we usually frame questions about human purpose and meaning. As the philosopher Brian O\u0026rsquo;Connor argues, thinking through idleness challenges us to rethink human freedom. Taking idleness seriously is also a way of taking seriously the idea that we might find meaning and significance entirely outside our concerns with work—and this opens up all kinds of interesting questions about human life.\nIn the piece after, we moved on to look at play. Here we circled back to Arendt\u0026rsquo;s account of human activity to ask what Arendt missed in her exploration of the vita activa. A lot of what we human beings (and other animals) spend our time doing is playing. So in this piece, we looked at finite and infinite games. We explored games where the stakes are high, and games where the point is just the playing itself. And we asked how it might be possible to rethink philosophy itself as a kind of play (so the next time you meet a philosopher, instead of asking them \u0026ldquo;what are you working on?\u0026rdquo;, maybe you could ask them \u0026ldquo;what are you playing with?\u0026rdquo;).\nLooking Back, Looking Forward This is a sketch map of the territory we have covered over the previous weeks. It feels that we have come a long way, but as always with philosophy, it also feels as if we have only just started to scratch the surface. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more we could have said about all of these topics—work, labour, salvation, activity and contemplation, idleness, play. But one thing is clear: there is nothing fixed or unchanging about the ways in which we work, or the ways in which we think about work.\nThis means that we can always rethink our assumptions about work, what it is, and why it matters. And we can also always find ways of working differently (or not-working differently) in the light of this.\nSo what does the future hold for work? Are we heading for an automated future where—as people have been predicting for decades—more and more of us are freed up for leisure? Will the robots dutifully take over all aspects of human drudgery, leaving us all free to enjoy Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s life of leisure? And if so, is this a good thing? If the ways in which we work are changing, how fairly are the benefits and harms of these changes distributed? How should meet the basic needs we all have, within the complex societies of which we are a part, if there are not enough jobs to go around? What about universal basic income? Is it a pathway to unlocking vast resources of human creativity and ingenuity, a way of mitigating endless economic and social hardship? Or is it a slippery slope to lassitude and spiritual decay?\nAll these questions are beyond the scope of this short course. But by now, it should be clear that the more you pick at the threads of our ideas about work, the more our everyday assumptions begin to unravel.\nSo instead of asking \u0026ldquo;is work good or bad for us?\u0026rdquo;, perhaps we should be asking more complicated and subtle questions. We should be asking what makes work good or bad, what else matters in human life, and how we can shape our cultures of work and non-work, to maximise human flourishing, and to ensure that this flourishing is evenly distributed.\nQuestions What do you think the future of work is? And what should it be? If in the future, Arendt\u0026rsquo;s labour was no longer an issue—if the basic needs of everybody could be met through automation—what would be the ideal form of life? Would it involve work, leisure, play, idleness, contemplation, or some combination of these things? How long have you been working? And how has the pattern of work changed for you over this period? How do you see it changing in the future? Can philosophy help you navigate the future of work (and non-work) better? If so, how? More further reading Books and articles For a recent, scholarly collection of essays on the future of work, try Michael Cholbi and Michael Weber\u0026rsquo;s edited collection The Future of Work, Technology, and Basic Income (Routledge 2019).\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s a piece from the Conversation about how robots won\u0026rsquo;t put an end to work, because work is a part of what makes us human.\nImage: Pieter Brueghel the Elder: Children\u0026rsquo;s Games. 1560.

            "content": "Life In China, Mencius is sometimes referred to as the Second Sage, meaning that in the Confucian tradition, he is second only to Confucius in importance. China\u0026rsquo;s Second Sage was born in the 4th century BCE in the state of Zou, in what is now present-day Shandong province. His estimated dates are either 372 – 289 BCE or 385 – c. 303 BCE.\nMencius\u0026rsquo;s given name was Meng Ke. The name “Mengzi”, means “master Meng”, the suffix zi being an honorific. When Jesuit scholars started translating Chinese texts into European languages, they Latinised his name to Mencius, just as they Latinised the name of China\u0026rsquo;s most famous philosopher, Master Kong or Kongzi, to Confucius.\nThe philosopher Bryan Van Norden has called Mencius the most influential philosopher whom you have never heard of. And even in China, even if everybody knows his name, Mencius is eclipsed by Confucius. This relative neglect is a shame because Mencius\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is every bit as fascinating and compelling as that of his predecessor.\nA talent for imitation Like Confucius, it is said the young Meng Ke lost his father when he was still young, so he was brought up by his mother. And perhaps the most famous story about Mencius\u0026rsquo;s early life is the story of his mother\u0026rsquo;s attempts to find a suitable place for them to live.\nThe story goes that little Meng Ke had a talent for imitation. He could pick up on what was going on around him and copy it. At first, the budding philosopher and his mother lived by a graveyard, and the boy spent his days playing at conducting funeral ceremonies or imitating the paid mourners. His mother, not convinced this was entirely wholesome, moved house. Next, they ended up living by a marketplace. This was an improvement, but with his penchant for imitation, little Meng Ke started to play at being a market-trader.\nHis exasperated mother had higher hopes for her son. They moved house again, this time settling near a school. This worked out better: Meng Ke saw the earnest students at their studies and copied them instead, and in time he became wise.\nAdvisor to dukes and kings Colourful legends on one side, we don\u0026rsquo;t really know much about Mencius. According to some accounts, Mencius was a student of Zisi, Confucius\u0026rsquo;s grandson, although this may simply be a way of bolstering Mencius\u0026rsquo;s importance by giving him a direct lineage to China\u0026rsquo;s most famous sage. And the first clear glimpse we get of Mencius is when he is in the middle of his life.\nBy this time, Mencius had become a roving teacher and counsellor who sought to advise rulers on how to rule with justice and propriety. His conversations with these rulers are recorded, almost certainly in idealised form, in the book that bears his name: the Mencius, or the Mengzi.\nTowards the end of his life, Mencius retired from politics, frustrated that his recommendations were falling on deaf ears. He returned to the state of Zou, and he died there in his seventies or eighties.\nPhilosophy The goodness of our nature Mencius is associated in particular with the argument that human nature is naturally good. The word for “nature” in Mencius is xing. As we saw on the Philosopher File on Yang Zhu, the idea of xing is rooted in metaphors of plant growth. Our xing isn\u0026rsquo;t something static and unchanging; instead, it is about how we grow, change and develop.\nFor Mencius, human nature is naturally good; but external conditions can lead to the stifling of this goodness. Not everybody agreed with Mencius\u0026rsquo;s take on human nature: another early Confucian thinker called Xunzi (c. 310- c. 235 BCE) argued the opposing view, that by nature we are crooked and badly formed. For Xunzi, human nature is bad, but it can be artificially made good thanks to the intervention of culture.\nBut against these claims, Mencius believes he has a knockout argument for human goodness. This is how he argues the case:\nThe reason why I say that all humans have hearts that are not unfeeling toward others is this. Suppose someone suddenly saw a child about to fall into a well: anyone in such a situation would have a feeling of alarm and compassion—not because one sought to get in good with the child’s parents, not because one wanted fame among one’s neighbors and friends, and not because one would dislike the sound of the child’s cries\u0026hellip;Mengzi 2A (translated Bryan Van Norden, p. 64).\nFour sprouts For Mencius, our innate goodness isn\u0026rsquo;t just one thing. It\u0026rsquo;s more like a bundle of different qualities. To be a virtuous human, you have to multitask. So Mencius identifies four different aspects of virtue, all of which he sees as being innate. He calls these “sprouts.”\nThe first sprout is ren, sometimes translated as humaneness or benevolence. You could think of ren as a kind of fellow-feeling for other beings.\nThe second sprout is called yi in Chinese. This is sometimes translated as “rightness” or “justice.” Mencius says yi is associated with a sense of shame, with that inner feel for whether we are acting well or badly.\nThe third sprout is li or ritual. This goes back to Confucius, who argued that ritual is an important component of shared human life. Ritual, Mencius says, is the heart or mind that respects others. It is about knowing when to go along with something and when to politely decline, when to act and when to not act, when to engage and when not. It is about the delicate nuances of our interpersonal relationships.\nThe final sprout is wisdom — or zhi in Chinese. This is the ability to distinguish between what is and what isn\u0026rsquo;t the case, what is and what isn\u0026rsquo;t true.\nIf you cultivate these four sprouts, Mencius maintains, then your virtues will flourish, like vigorous plants. Ethics is horticulture.\nOn Ox Mountain But if we all have these four sprouts of virtue, this leaves Mencius with an obvious problem: why is the world in such a mess?\nResponding to this objection, Mencius tells one of his most famous stories.\nThe trees of Ox Mountain were once beautiful. But because it bordered on a large state, hatchets and axes besieged it. Could it remain verdant? Due to the respite it got during the day or night, and the moisture of rain and dew, there were sprouts and shoots growing there. But oxen and sheep came and grazed on them. Hence, it was as if it were barren. Seeing it barren, people believed that there had never been any timber there. But could this be the nature of the mountainMengzi 6A (translated Bryan Van Norden, p 127).\nIt is not, Mencius is arguing, that we lack the capacity for virtue. It is that the conditions for nourishing our virtue are not in place. Worse than that, the conditions we live in often get in the way of the development of our virtues.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s up to us, but not entirely This means that virtue is up to us, but not entirely. We have some responsibility for nurturing our own sprouts of virtue. But this is only part of the story. On Ox Mountain, it is external forces that are really most destructive: the forces that cut down the trees and graze livestock on the tender shoots. So we need to be in an environment that supports the natural expression of this human goodness. Without the right environment, our goodness will be cut down by external forces, and any new shoots of goodness won\u0026rsquo;t grow.\nMencius maintains that things like hunger, poverty, injustice and need create chaotic and destructive social environments. And these environments get in the way of the flourishing of virtue. This has implications for how to govern. If we want to govern well, the priority is to meet people\u0026rsquo;s basic needs. But a wise ruler should also provide an education that supports the growth of a flourishing ethical life.\nIt was in pursuit of this vision that Mencius carried out his philosophy: talking to the rulers of his day, trying to get them to commit themselves to education, to justice, to fairness, and to an environment that supports the goodness latent in us all.\nFurther Reading Books My favourite translation is Bryan Van Norden\u0026rsquo;s Mengzi: with selections from traditional commentaries (Hackett 2008).\nFor more context, try Sarah Allen\u0026rsquo;s wonderful The Way of Water and the Sprouts of Virtue (SUNY Press 1997).\nMichael Puett and Christine Gross-Loh\u0026rsquo;s The Path: A New Way to Think About Everything (Penguin 2017) is a good introduction to Chinese traditions of philosophy.\nFor a more meaty read, try Owen Flanagan\u0026rsquo;s Moral Sprouts and Natural Teleologies: 21st Century Moral Psychology Meets Classical Chinese Philosophy (Marquette University Press 2014).\nOnline Resources Read Van Norden\u0026rsquo;s essay about Mencius over on Aeon Magazine.\nAnd see this little piece I wrote on Mencius and ethical rewilding.\nImage: Portrait of Mencius from Half Portraits of the Great Sage and Virtuous Men of Old (14th century, Anon).

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "In the last article in this series, we started exploring the opposite of work. If we want to understand the role that work has in human life, it is useful to think about all the things that we don\u0026rsquo;t consider to be work.\nOften we understand what things are in terms of what they are not. And this is certainly the case with work. So, we define work in opposition to other things that we see as non-work—for example idleness, or play. This means that, if we want to understand the role of work in our thinking and our lives, we need to explore the boundary between work and non-work, and we need to think through the varieties of non-work.\nLast week, we looked at one kind of non-work, and that is idleness. This week, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at play—something that is related to idleness, but that is not quite the same.\nHomo Ludens, or how we are made for play Much of our lives is involved with playing. We joke with our friends. We play games and sports. When nobody else is around, we try to balance tennis balls on our noses just for the sheer thrill of it, or at a quiet bus stop, we wonder how long we can stand on one leg.\nBut when it comes to more philosophical accounts of human life, play is often overlooked. A good example of this is Hannah Arendt\u0026rsquo;s The Human Condition, which we explored in the second piece in this series. Arendt divides human activity into three broad categories: labour, or meeting our basic needs; work, or producing new stuff; and action, which covers the ways in which we engage in the transformation of our shared world.\nArendt\u0026rsquo;s is a persuasive account. But what is striking is that, throughout her detailed and careful account of human activity, Arendt gives very little attention to play. But any account of human activity that doesn\u0026rsquo;t take play into account is going to end up giving us a curiously skewed vision of human existence.\nWhen you start to look for play, it is everywhere. As I write this, I look down into the square where I live in Sofia, Bulgaria. Two musicians are playing music. A teenager weaves through the crowd on a scooter, enjoying the arcs and the curves of their trajectory. Sitting on a bench, a woman plays on her phone. Outside the library, a child turns a sudden cartwheel\u0026hellip;\nThe universality of human play is one of the reasons that the historian Johan Huizinga, in one of the 20th century’s most famous books about play, argued that we were not only Homo sapiens, human primates who are wise, or even Homo faber, human primates who make things. We are also Homo ludens, human primates who play. Huizinga writes,\nThere is a third function, however, applicable to both human and animal life, and just as important as reasoning and making­ namely, playing. It seems to me that next to Homo Faber, and perhaps on the same level as Homo Sapiens, Homo Ludens, Man the Player, deserves a place in our nomenclature. [1]\nPlay is different from idleness, even if the two often overlap. One reason it is different is because it is purposive, even if the purpose may have no value beyond itself. The person who plays, unlike the idle person, is at least doing something and doing something that seems to have some point. This is why, as philosopher Brian O\u0026rsquo;Connor points out, play doesn\u0026rsquo;t have quite the same air of disreputability as idleness. [2] But play is also different from idleness because it usually involves some kind of skill. Whether we are playing chess, or juggling, or playing the harp, or playing ball games, we are testing ourselves against our opponent or against the world, we are trying to find out what is possible for us: Can we really stand on one leg for the twenty minutes until the bus comes? Can we really beat this person at chess? Will the ball balance on our nose? And so on.\nFun in the animal kingdom Play is not just a human phenomenon. Huizinga recognised this when he said that play is “applicable to both human and animal life.” Cats and dogs play. Lemurs play. Crows play. Otters love messing around. Far from being only a cultural phenomenon, play precedes human culture altogether. Huizinga puts it like this:\nPlay is older than culture, for culture, however inadequately defined, always presupposes human society, and animals have not waited for man to teach them their playing. We can safely assert, even, that human civilization has added no essential feature to the general idea of play. Animals play just like men. We have only to watch young dogs to see that all the essentials of human play are present in their merry gambols. [3]\nAnd like human play, animal play is fun. In his book on animal pleasure, Pleasurable Kingdom, Jonathan Balcombe writes,\nThough play is undeniably adaptive, it is pleasure, curiosity, and joy that provide the motivation for play in animals and humans alike. Play is a good indicator of well-being. It occurs when other needs, such as food, shelter and safety, are sufficiently met, and when unpleasant feelings like fear, anxiety and pain are minimal or absent. Otherwise the animal’s efforts would be directed at meeting these needs or relieving these feelings, at the expense of play. [4]\nPlay happens when we are freed up, if even for just a moment, from the demands of labour, and from having to attend to immediate questions of survival. Whether we are human beings or any other kind of animal, play takes place when our minimum needs are met. It takes place when we no longer have to worry about what Hannah Arendt calls labour.\nBalcombe goes on to argue that animal play (and, therefore, human play too) exists for good evolutionary reasons. But these reasons are not what motivates animals, including ourselves, to play. As individuals, we are motivated to play not because it is adaptive, but because play feels good.\nPlay serves many functions that may help an animal to survive and succeed in life. These include: developing physical strength, gaining skills, acquiring knowledge, learning the ropes of social behavior, and exploring. This is probably why it evolved. But when a pair of mountain goat kids chase each other, jumping, twisting and kicking, they are hardly training for becoming good grown-ups. Animals play for fun, not for keeps. [5]\nWhen Margaret the cat hides behind the armchair and then ambushes me as I pass by—grabbing hold of my legs with her claws retracted, then hurtling away across the room before circling back for a bit of fuss—she is not doing this out of a high-minded desire to keep in training (although I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t bet on the chances of any mouse who came her way). She is doing it because it’s a bit of a laugh, because she likes to surprise me like this.\nAnd it is the same for us. We are into play not because of what it can do for us, but for its own sake: because playing is fun and gratifying. We play (you, me, and Margaret too) because we like playing.\nPlay, chance, and rules But what does it mean to play? Play is something that happens at the meeting point of predictability and unpredictability. It involves both regularity and also surprise. In his book Truth and Method, the philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer writes that,\nIn order for there to be a game, there always has to be, not necessarily literally another player, but something else with which the player plays and which automatically responds to his move with a countermove. Thus the cat at play chooses the ball of wool because it responds to play, and ball games will be with us forever because the ball is freely mobile in every direction, appearing to do surprising things of its own accord. [6]\nBut play also involves predictability and rules. If you offer me a game of Scrabble, and then you make up the rules as you go along, I\u0026rsquo;m unlikely to want to continue playing with you. The fun is testing our skills against each other as we together navigate a passage between the random chance of what letters we receive and the invariable rules of the game.\nThis is why Gadamer argues that play is also a serious business. He writes that “seriousness in playing is necessary to make the play wholly play,” Gadamer writes. “Someone who doesn’t take the game seriously is a spoilsport” [7] This is true also for games where the rules are more tacit than explicit. To continue playing along you need to be attuned to these tacit rules. Without this awareness, it is easy to derail the game and derail the fun.\nOne of the tacit rules of the ambush game I play with Margaret the cat is that I good-naturedly let her attack me, and after she has done this, she comes back so that I can give her a bit of fuss. But if when she ambushed me, I freaked out, yelling at her and storming out of the room, I would clearly have broken our tacit agreement about how things should go. The game would be ruined. And Margaret could justifiably brand me a spoilsport.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not about winning, unless it is about winning So why do we play? For some kinds of play, the fact that there are winners and losers is an integral part of the game. But this isn\u0026rsquo;t true in all kinds of play. A helpful distinction is made by James Carse, the scholar of religion, between finite and infinite games. In his book, Finite and Infinite Games, Carse writes,\nThere are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play. [8]\nWhen I was at school, being generally inept on the sports field, people sometimes told me that winning and losing were not the most important things. What was important, these kind souls told me, was taking part. But this is not quite true. For many finite games, winning and losing are a part of the fun. And this means that playing against somebody who always loses (I really was that inept…) is really no fun at all. Winning may not be the only pleasure, but if you are playing football or Scrabble or any other finite game that entails the possibility of winners and losers, then for many players, if your opponent is hopeless, or if your opponent doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about winning, this spoils the point of the game. Part of the fun is that you care and that your opponent cares.\nBut with infinite games—like the infinite fun to be had playing mouse-on-a-string, one of Margaret\u0026rsquo;s favourite games (with a toy mouse attached to a long string)—the fun of the game is not bound up with winning and losing, or with the outcome. The point of play is to sustain itself, to keep this attitude of playfulness going (until we get hungry, or tired, or bored, or distracted, and go and do something else).\nPlay and playfulness In her brilliant book Metaphor and Metaphilosophy: Philosophy as Combat, Play, and Aesthetic Experience, philosopher Sarah Mattice explores both the philosophy of play, and also the idea that philosophy itself could be seen as a kind of play. Mattice draws on the work of María Lugones to argue that the attitude of playfulness is “an approach to others that respects them while attempting to enter into relations of understanding.” [9]\nThese others might be our fellow human beings. But many things can count as others in this sense: other people, animals, or even things. When playing mouse-on-a-string with Margaret, I\u0026rsquo;m interacting with her in a way that attempts to understand her more. And this attempt at understanding is where a lot of the fun lies (I am also, of course, attempting to understand better the physics of toy mice attached to strings). And when I realise that I “get” Margaret, that I understand her behaviours a little more deeply, or when I intuit that through our game Margaret “gets” me, the game is immensely gratifying.\nThis may sound sentimental. But if we are human animals, and if play is something that we do by virtue of being animals, then this is more than sentiment. It is a recognition that Margaret and I, as animals who are trying to navigate the world we share, are interested in testing out each other and our shared world. We are interested in finding out about each other, and about the world we inhabit together. As the Renaissance French philosopher, Michel de Montaigne asked, “When I play with my cat, how do I know that she is not passing time with me rather than I with her?” [10]\nSeen like this, playfulness is a way of connecting more deeply with the many things—cats, dogs, juggling balls, human beings, footballs, dice, Scrabble tiles, toy mice tied to strings—with which we share the world. And for this reason, playfulness could be seen as an attitude that is more fundamental than play itself. Mattice argues that,\nTo be playful with things, events, and others in the world is to bring to every situation an attitude that has the potential to turn that situation into play. [11]\nPhilosophy as an infinite game Mattice pushes her argument further to suggest that philosophy itself could be seen as a kind of infinite game. Sometimes we think of philosophy as a kind of combat—as a kind of finite game. We debate with each other, we compete for who has the best arguments in the marketplace of ideas, and ultimately, there are winners and losers.\nBut do we have to see philosophy like this? Is engaging in antagonistic debate really the best way to try to orientate our lives towards greater wisdom? Or does the metaphor of play (or is it more than a metaphor?) offer us another way of thinking of philosophy? Mattice writes,\nUnderstanding philosophical activity as play means seeing it as an activity that has no beginning and no end, but that is ceaselessly transforming and changing. Philosophical thinking as play\u0026hellip; does not fix itself in any one position, but treats each position as a temporary lodging-place, moving flexibly at the axis of the wheel. The philosopher, in playing, has no set purpose or goal in mind, other than enjoyment of the activity itself. [12]\nThis is not, as Mattice herself knows, the last word on what philosophy is or what it could be. But it is a valuable counter-balance to the idea that philosophy is—inherently and by its very nature—about confrontation, and about a contest of ideas in which there are winners and losers.\nQuestions What do you think main differences are between infinite and finite games? Which do you prefer? Is play always the opposite of work? Or is it possible to work playfully? How does this change our experience of work? Is seriousness involved in all kinds of play, or only some of them? Can the idea of play be integrated into Arendt\u0026rsquo;s account of the active life? If so, how? What are the implications of thinking about philosophy as a kind of play? How might this transform our approach to philosophising?

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life The great ventriloquist Plato was born in Athens some time between 428 and 423 BCE to a high-ranking Athenian family. Plato\u0026rsquo;s family took particular pride in being related to the great statesman Solon who lived two centuries before, and who put in place the laws that underpinned Athenian democracy.\nLike many other philosophers in Ancient Greece, Plato wrote his philosophical works in a literary form. But where Parmenides and Xenophanes wrote in verse, Plato\u0026rsquo;s preferred form was dialogue. This makes Plato something of a ventriloquist-philosopher: in his dialogues, he channels his ideas through the mouths of others — most of all, his teacher Socrates. And this ventriloquism has led to centuries of debate about which ideas belong to Plato, which to Socrates, and which to the other participants in his dialogues.\nThe student of Socrates When he was still young, Plato fell under the spell of Socrates. And he remained a part of Socrates\u0026rsquo;s circle until his mentor was put to death in 399 BCE.\nAfter this, it is likely that Plato left Athens, and travelled throughout the Greek-speaking world, and perhaps as far as Egypt. His work shows how broadly he studied. He was influenced by the Pythagorean philosophers, by Parmenides, and by Heraclitus. And the references to Egypt throughout his work suggest that, whether or not Plato visited Africa, he was influenced by Egyptian traditions of philosophy that reached back centuries.\nPlato returned from his travels to settle in Athens when he was around forty years old. After his return, he set up a philosophical school of his own, the Academy. One of the most famous of his students was Aristotle, who later went on to develop — and fiercely criticise — his teacher\u0026rsquo;s work.\nPlato continued to teach until his death, in his early or mid-eighties.\nPhilosophy Plato\u0026rsquo;s philosophical ventriloquism gives his philosophy a very distinctive feel: he is not just telling us how things are; instead, he is showing us how people come together and engage in debate in an attempt to get closer to the truth. What Plato wants to give us in his work is not philosophy as a set of ideas. Instead, he wants to give us a record of philosophy as an activity — as an exploration of things that matter, undertaken by living, thinking human beings.\nWhen you read Plato, what you are getting is a sense of thinking in action.\nPhilosophy as midwifery Often, the main speaker in Plato\u0026rsquo;s dialogues is Socrates — or an idealised version of Socrates who seems to have a fitting response (although not always an answer) to every question, and an uncanny ability to tie everybody else up in knots.\nIn Plato\u0026rsquo;s Theaetetus, Socrates describes himself as a midwife who assists at the birth of truth, providing precisely the kind of encouragement, the right salves and potions, to help the people he is speaking to give birth to true knowledge, or perhaps even to wisdom. But giving birth to wisdom is not something that Socrates can do for other people. Socrates claims he does not instruct, he simply assists in this process of developing wisdom, something that we must all undergo individually.\nPlato takes this idea of philosophy as midwifery seriously. And this is why the dialogue form is so important to him. He wants to avoid giving us the answers. Instead, he wants to lead us — like Socrates — to discovering the truth for ourselves. And what better way of doing this than presenting argument and counter-argument for us to pick through, leaving room for ambiguity and for our own questioning?\nLife in the cave But that isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that Plato doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a very distinctive and specific vision of what truth might be.\nIn setting out this vision, Plato often talks in myths, fables, allegories, and stories. And one of the most famous of all these stories is the allegory of the cave from the Republic. It is a very weird story indeed, but it is also one that symbolically connects to Socrates\u0026rsquo;s view of philosophy as midwifery.\nSOCRATES: Imagine human beings living in an underground, cavelike dwelling, with an entrance a long way up, which is both open to the light and as wide as the cave itself. They’ve been there since childhood, fixed in the same place, with their necks and legs fettered, able to see only in front of them, because their bonds prevent them from turning their heads around. Light is provided by a fire burning far above and behind them. Also behind them, but on higher ground, there is a path stretching between them and the fire. Imagine that along this path a low wall has been built, like the screen in front of puppeteers above which they show their puppets.GLAUCON: I\u0026rsquo;m imagining it.SOCRATES: Then also imagine that there are people along the wall, carrying all kinds of artifacts that project above it—statues of people and other animals, made out of stone, wood, and every material. And, as you’d expect, some of the carriers are talking, and some are silent.GLAUCON: It’s a strange image you’re describing, and strange prisoners\u0026hellip;The Republic (514a-515a)\nSlipping our chains It is indeed a strange image. But the point is this: for the fettered prisoners, their whole reality will be the shadows that are thrown on the walls of the cave. Behind them, the nefarious puppeteers carry models of donkeys, people and other things. And the hapless prisoners see the mere shadows of the models of things, and assume that these shadows are the things themselves.\nIn the second part of this series on Plato, I\u0026rsquo;ll delve more into Plato\u0026rsquo;s concern with shadows, models, and imitations. But for now, we\u0026rsquo;ll just look at what the allegory of the cave says about Plato\u0026rsquo;s view of philosophy: a difficult process through which we — locked in the caves of our ignorance — attain to a greater truth.\nSocrates goes on to imagine one of these prisoners unchained. At first, they might be confused, uncertain of what they were seeing. Everything would be different and strange. And if they tottered a little way up the path to the outside, they would recoil from the light, and be momentarily blinded. It would take somebody to assist at the birth of their wisdom: a philosophical midwife like Socrates.\nSOCRATES: And if someone dragged him away from there by force, up the rough, steep path, and didn’t let him go until he had dragged him into the sunlight, wouldn’t he be pained and irritated at being treated that way? And when he came into the light, with the sun filling his eyes, wouldn’t he be unable to see a single one of the things now said to be true?The Republic (515e)\nAnd yet, once this ex-prisoner\u0026rsquo;s eyes adjusted to the light, they would see the whole world — the things of the world, the sky, the light of the stars and the sun. And they would be amazed by how much greater this reality was than what they had imagined when stuck in the cave.\nThe philosopher Parmenides had argued that the world of appearances—the way things seemed to be—was at odds with reality. Plato takes up this idea, and tries to convince us that the world that we experience day by day is a mere shadow of the true richness of the world: a richness that we attain by pursuing the path of philosophy.\nThe prison of ignorance The allegory of the cave ends with a dispiriting thought. Once the former prisoner saw the truth, they might want to set about liberating all the others from their captivity. After all, if the true reality really is so much greater than the shadowy world of appearances, why wouldn\u0026rsquo;t you want to share it?\nBut if this newly released prisoner went back into the cave and tried to liberate their former comrades from their captivity, they would meet with incomprehension, anger, ridicule, and even violence. “And as for anyone who tried to free the prisoners and lead them upward,” Socrates asks, “if they could somehow get their hands on him, wouldn’t they kill him?” It is a clear reference to Socrates\u0026rsquo;s eventual fate, put to death by his fellow Athenian citizens.\nThe allegory of the cave has philosophical depths that we\u0026rsquo;ll explore further in a later philosopher file. And we\u0026rsquo;ll have more to say about appearances, reality, shadows and imitations. But we can already see how this allegory also provides two important ideas that have shaped how Plato\u0026rsquo;s successors have imagined philosophy, down to the present day.\nThe first the idea that philosophy is essentially about the search for a truth that is hidden behind the world of appearances, and that this search is a difficult, individual ascent from darkness towards light.\nAnd the second is the pessimistic idea that even if we can attain this truth, when we speak it to others we are liable to be misunderstood, ridiculed, derided—or even killed. Because, as T.S. Eliot put it in the Four Quartets, \u0026ldquo;Humankind cannot bear very much reality.\u0026rdquo;\nFurther Reading Books Julia Annas\u0026rsquo;s book Plato: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2003) is a great, accessible way into his work.\nPlato is a very readable writer. A good, comprehensive collection is Plato: Complete Works (Hackett 1997), edited by John M. Cooper. This is the version I\u0026rsquo;ve used here.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a good translation of Plato\u0026rsquo;s Republic by G.A.M. Grube, also published by Hackett (1992).\nFinally, for something totally different, try José Saramago\u0026rsquo;s The Cave (Mariner Books 2003), a novel that riffs on themes from Plato.\nOnline Resources If you haven\u0026rsquo;t watched it already, you really should watch this claymation adaptation of Plato\u0026rsquo;s cave. It departs from the letter of Plato\u0026rsquo;s story in a couple of places, but gives a real sense of the spirit of what Plato is trying to say.\nImage: Plato. Etching by D. Cunego, 1783, after R.

            "content": "Over the last four articles in this series, we have been exploring divergent ideas of work. What is work? What role does it play in human life? How can we think better about work? Is work our salvation or our ruin? Is it the path that leads to virtue, or does it lead to our own destruction?\nBut when you start to think about work, you are also—by implication at least—thinking about non-work. These ideas of non-work form the backdrop for our thoughts about work. So in the next two pieces, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look more deeply at two kinds of non-work: idleness and play. And we\u0026rsquo;ll start with idleness.\nKurt Vonnegut once wrote, “I tell you, we are here on Earth to fart around, and don\u0026rsquo;t let anybody tell you different.” For many thinkers, this kind of “farting around” (or idleness) is a vice in need of correction. Benedict of Nursia, who wrote the book on monasticism, argued that idleness opens the door towards sin, and is ruinous of our virtue. John Locke (1632-1704) argued that even in our leisure time, we should bury ourselves in useful pursuits because uselessness causes anxiety and makes us unhappy. And Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) argued work is a purifying fire that frees us from all ills.\nBut should we dismiss idleness quite so easily? Or do we need to take it more seriously as a central component of human life?\nWork, Idleness, and Rest Within cultures preoccupied by the idea that work is inherently valuable—for example the culture of Benedict\u0026rsquo;s monastery—there is often a clear line between idleness and rest. Rest is non-working for the sake of work. You have had a busy week, so you take a weekend to rest and recharge your batteries. Then you can return to work with renewed vigour. In his monastic rule, Benedict accepted the need for rest because rest is a necessary part of a life structured in accordance with work. We are not automata. We do not have infinite resources available to us. Rest is a way of maintaining our vigour and focus in a life built around work.\nIf rest is necessary to support work, idleness is—as Benedict knew—a far more subversive, or even corrosive, idea. Idleness is non-working, but not for the sake of work. Instead, idleness is non-working for its own sake. It is a kind of non-working that refuses to frame our understanding of what makes human life good or meaningful in terms of the work we do.\nThis is why the idea of idleness can be so very challenging. Work is often the framing narrative we use so we can understand our lives and the value of our lives (“What do you do?” we ask a new acquaintance). From the point of view of this framing narrative, the measure of a person is not how much fun they have, or whether they enjoy lying on their backs in the sun, or whether they are good to hang out with. Instead, it is the work that they do.\nBut when we start to take idleness seriously, we can step outside this frame, and think about human life differently.\nBeyond productivity The way we think about work and idleness says a lot about our notion of what a life ideally lived might look like, or what human flourishing might look like.\nWithin work cultures, we often hunger to become more successful, more efficient, more productive, more creative. And we take this continual enhancement to be a vision of human flourishing. But this is not the only possible vision of human flourishing, and it is a vision that can come at a cost: burn-out, anxiety, the nagging fear that the things that we are so frenetically producing may be of little worth, and so on. It also comes at the risk of failure: in a world defined by success, not everyone can be successful. And falling short of the demands that we should succeed can be a severe blow to our self-esteem.\nBut perhaps there are different ways of framing human life. What if we realigned our values so that we didn\u0026rsquo;t see work and productivity as the centre-pieces of a life well lived? What if, instead of ceaselessly doing stuff, we tried to cultivate doing nothing, at least once in a while? As Jenny Odell writes in her recent book How to Do Nothing: Resisting the Attention Economy, in a world obsessed by productivity, idleness might be an act of political resistance.\nI consider “doing nothing” both as a kind of deprogramming device and as sustenance for those feeling too disassembled to act meaningfully. On this level, the practice of doing nothing has several tools to offer us when it comes to resisting the attention economy. [1]\nRethinking non-work One of the philosophical texts that most directly challenges our ideas about work and non-work is the Chinese Daoist text known as the Zhuangzi. Although the many stories in the Zhuangzi recognise the value of craft, skill and work, it is also a book that sings the praises of farting around, and directly questions the idea that we should cultivate usefulness as a means of validating our existence.\nAn image that crops up again and again in the Zhuangzi is that of a tree so old and gnarly, so twisted out of shape, that it is of no use to anybody. In one passage, a carpenter called Shi and his apprentice stand admiring an old tree. Shi says,\nThis is worthless lumber! As a ship it would soon sink, as a coffin it would soon rot, as a tool it would soon break, as a door it would leak sap, as a pillar it would bring infestation. This is a talentless, worthless tree. It is precisely because it is so useless that it has lived so long. [2]\nAnd for the Zhuangzi, there is something exemplary in a gnarly old tree like this. Trying to be useful risks harming our nature. But being useless is a way of guaranteeing our longer-term well-being. Later on in the text, the argument is summarised like this:\nThe mountain tree plunders itself. The candle fat scorches itself. The cinnamon tree is edible, and thus it gets chopped down. The lacquer tree is useful, and thus it is cut down. Everyone knows how useful usefulness is, but no one seems to know how useful uselessness is. [3]\nBeing useless, the Zhuangzi suggests, unhitches our life from the instrumental demands of those who might seek to control us, who might seek to use us as raw material in their schemes, to chop us up and turn us into useful things. Usefulness puts us in danger. If we really want to live out our span of years, our best bet, the Zhuangzi suggests, is to make ourselves as useless as possible.\nDefining idleness The Zhuangzi challenges us to rethink our assumptions about whether useful activity can really be the hallmark of a life well-lived. Perhaps we need to give idleness more of a hearing.\nIn his fascinating recent philosophy of idleness, Brian O\u0026rsquo;Connor sets out to do just this. In his book, O\u0026rsquo;Connor does not necessarily advocate for idleness. Instead, what he is suggesting is more subtle and more far-reaching. He is suggesting that if we take the challenge of idleness seriously, it forces us to rethink all the parameters in terms of which we judge life to be good or well-lived, and to ask some deep questions about the meaning of human freedom.\nO\u0026rsquo;Connor sets out some characteristics of idleness. Idleness, he says, involves “noncompulsion and drift.” The author of the Zhuangzi, called this noncompulsion xiao yao you or “free and easy wandering.” When you are wandering freely and easily, you are not goal-oriented: you are not aiming at anything. You are drifting, and enjoying the deliciousness of being without purposes and goals.\nThis leads us to another characteristic of idleness: it isn\u0026rsquo;t aimed at productivity. Thoughts may come to us in idleness, or they may not. But if they come at all, they come serendipitously. And not just thoughts. If we are sitting on the porch with a block of wood and a knife, if we have sufficient idleness, we may find ourselves whittling a spoon out of the wood (to take the classic example). But our whittling is not purposive, and the spoon just emerges from the wood serendipitously.\nA further characteristic, O\u0026rsquo;Connor argues, is that idleness does not involve discipline and self-monitoring. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t aim at self-realization or self-betterment. The idle self couldn\u0026rsquo;t care less about these things. It is, O\u0026rsquo;Connor argues, at home with itself. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t see happiness as an achievement or a reward, but is just happy to be the kind of being that it is.\nDespite all this, O\u0026rsquo;Connor says, idleness is not mindless. It knows what it is doing and knows what it is about, even if it has no particular end or purpose.\nO\u0026rsquo;Connor concludes by saying,\n[Idleness] does, after all, seem to place us in a liberating possession of ourselves, free of pressure, and evidently content. From these characteristics it is obvious that idleness stands in opposition to much of what is taken to be right and normal: it has nothing to do with performance, with work, with social standing, with gaining in prestige. [4]\nThe freedom of doing nothing In a culture obsessed by work and productivity, and the prestige of work and productivity, we often think of freedom as something that is won through our work. So if you work for a sufficient number of years, you are considered to have earned your retirement. And once you are retired, it is okay to be idle—but only because through work you have earned the right to be idle. Non-work is an achievement, one that you can only reach (if you care about virtue) by means of work.\nBut both the Zhuangzi and O\u0026rsquo;Connor suggest a more radical vision of freedom. What if the opportunities for freedom were there all along, and to attain to this freedom what we need to do is not to work for our freedom, but instead to give up on our obsession with work?\nThis is why—for Jenny Odell, for the Zhuangzi and for Brian O\u0026rsquo;Connor—a reappraisal of idleness offers us something radically transformative. O\u0026rsquo;Connor writes,\nThe case for idleness [\u0026hellip;] will depend on whether questions of freedom can be asked without framing the answers within notions of the type of people required by modern societies. The implications of such a shift are not insignificant. They point to the implausible-sounding scenario in which the phenomena of usefulness, competitive social identities, or long-term discipline no longer form the outlines of our experience. A reappraisal of idleness is, in this respect, also criticism of those notions of freedom that work in favor of life determined in those ways. [5]\nIdleness for all! However, there are important questions of social justice here. Remember that Aristotle himself believed work-free leisure to be the best and most noble form of human life, but he also recognised that this kind of existence was only possible on the understanding that certain groups of people—slaves, servants, women—provided the labour that enabled this leisure to exist.\nBut not all idleness is the same. Blanket approval of idleness, or blanket condemnation, misses much of what is interesting about idleness as a component of human life. In exactly the same way, blanket approval of work, or blanket condemnation, misses much of what is interesting about work as a component of human life. Cultures of work can be conducive to building a more just and equal society, or can serve to further entrench injustice and inequality. And it is the same with cultures of idleness.\nIn her brief history of European ideas of idleness, Ingrid Nelson draws a distinction between simple slothfulness (the kind of personal idleness that the Romans called accidia) and civic-minded leisure (which the Romans called otium). __ Nelson argues that instead of simply arguing for or against idleness, we should instead develop a more subtle ethics of idleness. Because if we play it right, thinking better about idleness might be one way that we resist the demands upon us. And this might help us to restructure our societies, to make them more equitable and more conducive to flourishing for all.\nSo, should you be more idle? The answer, Nelson suggests, is complicated. It depends on how you play it.\nPersonal idleness restores and renews but can also lead to antisocial or exploitative behavior. Civic-minded idleness acknowledges our connection with society even as we withdraw from it, giving us space to explore, play and discover. Ultimately, this should lead to a more equitable society. [6]\nThis question of exploration, play and discovery is something we\u0026rsquo;ll pick up again in the next piece when we look at another aspect of non-work, and explore the philosophy of play.\nQuestions In what ways is uselessness useful? Can idleness really be an effective form of political resistance as Jenny Odell suggests? When have you felt most truly free? When you are working? When you are idle? Or some combination of the two? What is your own experience of idleness? Does it make you anxious (like John Locke)? Or do you enjoy the “free and easy wandering” that comes from being idle? Is there something inherently unjust or inequitable about the idea of idleness? Or can idleness support a more just and equitable society?

            "content": "In last week\u0026rsquo;s piece, we explored how work might of benefit to us—how it might even be our salvation. For some thinkers, work is inherently ennobling and self-improving. It is, as Carlyle put it, a “purifying fire, wherein all poison is burnt up.”\nEven if we don\u0026rsquo;t go as far as Carlyle, we have already seen that work can be beneficial in that it provides us with a range of both internal and external goods. Work gives us a social context. If it is the right kind of work, it makes use of our skills in a satisfying way. It develops those skills further (and developing skills is fun). It can be stimulating and enjoyable. And it enables us to provide for ourselves and those close to us.\nThese are all good things. So there\u0026rsquo;s no wonder that research shows that work can be an important factor contributing to the sense we might have that our lives are going well for us—what has come to be known as our “subjective well-being.” And any account of work (for example, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s) that ignores these positive aspects, and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t pay any attention to the internal and external goods that work provides is going to fall short.\nNevertheless, work is often burdensome, hard or even soul-destroying. When we talk about work, we sometimes do so with excitement and enthusiasm, but equally frequently we do so with a sense of frustration or heaviness. Work gets us down.\nWhy is this the case, given all the research that shows how work is good for us? Is there something wrong with us? Are we just being perverse when we complain about work? Or is there a darker side to work?\nThe darker side of work One recent thinker, the anthropologist David Graeber, believes there is. In his essay—and later his book—on the phenomenon of what he calls “bullshit jobs”, Graeber talks about the “moral and spiritual damage” of our modern work-cultures. Our modern-day attitudes to work, Graeber writes, constitute a “scar across our collective soul.”\nIn this piece, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look at three ways in which our cultures of work may be the cause of a kind of moral or spiritual damage: the first is unemployment, the second is overwork, and the third is Graeber\u0026rsquo;s phenomenon of “bullshit jobs.”\nBut first, I want to say something about the term “spiritual.” When talking about the spiritual damage caused by work, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean anything mystical or religious (and neither does Graeber). Instead, I am using the term “spiritual” to capture the all-pervading effect our attitudes to work have on our existence. When work gets us down, we feel dispirited. It feels as if something has left us: a sense of liveliness, hope, creativity, excitement. “Spiritual” harm, in this sense, refers to the way that work can make our lives less spirited, less lively, less full and rich and meaningful.\nOffice life, 1957. From the Dutch National Archives via Wikimedia Commons.\nOn the spiritual harms of unemployment It is often argued that work is good for us because unemployment is so clearly bad for us. In his book on the philosophy of work, Lars Svendsen cites A. Kim Burton and Gordon Waddell\u0026rsquo;s report Is Work Good for Your Health and Well-Being? This report, commissioned by the British government and published in 2006, seems to provide robust support for the idea that working is good for us, and that unemployment is correspondingly bad for us. Svendsen summarises Burton and Waddell\u0026rsquo;s findings as follows,\nIn terms of a negative effect on happiness, or “subjective well-being” as it is often called in empirical studies, unemployment is one of the things with the highest impact, along with serious illness and divorce. It seems that loss of income is only a minor part of this and that other factors have greater impact than the purely economic ones. The “typical” unemployed will have less social interaction with others and lower self-esteem. People take unemployment personally. [1]\nUnemployment deprives us of income, of status and of social interaction. No wonder it is so destructive. The authors of the report conclude that,\nThere is a strong evidence base showing that work is generally good for physical and mental health and well-being. Worklessness is associated with poorer physical and mental health and well-being. Work can be therapeutic and can reverse the adverse health effects of unemployment. [2]\nThis suggests that Benedict of Nursia was onto something when—as we saw last time—he counselled that in the monastery, “Brothers who are sick or weak should be given a type of work or craft that will keep them busy without overwhelming them or driving them away.” [3] And Burton and Waddell\u0026rsquo;s report seems to provide pretty compelling evidence that we\u0026rsquo;re better off working than not working.\nHowever, we need to look at this more closely, because this litany of the harms of unemployment is a less compelling argument for the goodness of work than it first seems.\nOne obvious benefit of work is that it provides us with income. Burton and Waddell write that for those who are unemployed,\nRe-entering work (rather than simply moving off benefits) is generally associated with improvement in income, socio-economic status, mental and general health, and well-being. [4]\nThis is not surprising. Having insufficient income to support ourselves and those who depend upon us is a genuine harm. But the absence of income is not inherent to being outside of a waged job. It is possible to envisage alternative social systems—ones with substantial unemployment benefits, or where there is some kind of universal basic income—that might mitigate these harms of being out of work. The issue here is not the absence of work itself, but the absence of sufficient income to live a life where one can meet one\u0026rsquo;s needs.\nAnother benefit of work is that it gives us a concrete social (or socio-economic) status. We are social primates, and status matters to us. But here again, we need to look more closely. The reason that being outside of waged work entails an absence of status is that we live in a culture where one of the major determinants of status is what waged work we do. If unemployment is seen as being low-status—or even blameable—this is because we live in a culture that places a huge moral value on waged work. The loss of status that goes with unemployment is not due to the absence of work. It is due to a culture that sees work as the highest good, and unemployment as a state that is morally reprehensible.\n\u0026ldquo;If I only had a job\u0026rdquo;: 1898 musical score. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nBurton and Waddell\u0026rsquo;s conclusions are not without nuance. They caution that work is only better than unemployment if you have what they call a “good job”— a job that supports our health and well-being, and that gives us sufficient autonomy to feel that we are active agents in the world.\nBut it\u0026rsquo;s possible to turn this round, and to ask if there are “good “and “bad” jobs, why there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be “good” and “bad” forms of unemployment as well. In other words, the reason that unemployment is bad for us is that we are committed to sustaining a system of bad unemployment, a system in which unemployment necessarily compromises health, well-being, and autonomy. Arguably, a more humane political and social system would ask not just how to make work good, but also unemployment. It would be a system that saw some degree of support for our health, well-being and autonomy not as things that we achieve when we enter the world of work, but as the non-negotiable ground of our existence as citizens.\nOn the spiritual harms of overwork Nevertheless, Burton and Waddell\u0026rsquo;s caution about “good jobs” is important. Because while we can find meaning and purpose in work, not all jobs will enable us to do this. And this leads us to another potential spiritual harm caused by work: the harm of simply working too hard. In a culture that is driven by an overarching work ethic, a culture that sees work as a path to virtue, it is easy to see how overwork can become a problem. The harder we work, the more virtuous we feel ourselves to be. We are encouraged to compete with each other for the status that comes from being the most virtuous and the most hard-working. And in cultures such as this, being worn out and ragged is seen as a badge of virtue.\nThis, of course, comes at significant cost. But it is not inevitable that we view work like this. We\u0026rsquo;ve already seen one philosopher—Aristotle—who is sceptical about the value of work, and who sees work as something that is “unchoiceworthy” and that we should limit as far as possible. Meanwhile, over in China, the *Zhuangzi—*a text attributed to the 4th century BCE philosopher Zhuang Zhou—offers a fascinating insight into how we might work differently.\nZhuang Zhou by a waterfall. Via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Zhuangzi is sometimes represented as a kind of slacker text that encourages us to bunk off work as much as we possibly can. But it is more interesting than that. What the Zhuangzi encourages us to do is to think about what it means to work in a way that nourishes our life (the Chinese term for this is yang sheng). To nourish our life is to guard our energy and our vitality, whatever activity we are engaged in. This idea of life as something to be nourished is associated with the famous idea of wu-wei, which is sometimes translated as “non-doing”, but which could be better understood as optimally minimising our activity. The idea of wu-wei is that we should do as little as we can to accomplish what we want to accomplish, and no more. Because anything beyond this risks sapping our spirits and exhausting us. In his brilliant book, Trying Not to Try, Edward Slingerland writes,\nWu-wei is characterized by an internal sense of effortlessness and unselfconsciousness, even though the person in wu-wei may actually be very active in the world. [5]\nThe Zhuangzi often presents wu-wei as a personal achievement. But if we care about the spiritual harms of work, perhaps we need to think about how our cultures of work wear us out and exhaust us, and put in place new approaches to work that are rooted in the idea of optimally minimising our effort, so that we can nourish our lives.\nOn the spiritual harms of bullshit The final spiritual harm of work that I want to consider here is the spiritual harm of what Graeber calls “bullshit jobs.” A bullshit job is a job which simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to exist, a job that, while you are doing it, you know is fruitless, pointless or without any value. Graeber defines it like this:\na bullshit job is a form of employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence. [6]\nWhat is crucial to Graeber\u0026rsquo;s definition is that the employee themselves has this nagging suspicion—or this clear apprehension—that their job has no actual value. Bullshit jobs are particularly weird because although they may be lucrative, and they may even entail nothing objectively unpleasant (you may have a good salary, be in a warm office, have plenty of time on your hands, and nobody bothering you), they are still strangely harmful. Their sheer pointlessness—the knowledge that if this job disappeared entirely, the world would be more or less unchanged—is somehow spiritually corrosive.\nEven many jobs that seem objectively useful may seem to involve large amounts of bullshit: in other words, innumerable tasks that serve no obvious purpose, that are there simply to keep us busy, or to make people look good, or to fulfil meaningless criteria. And this bullshit is destructive of our well-being. Graeber writes that,\nBullshit jobs regularly induce feelings of hopelessness, depression, and self-loathing. They are forms of spiritual violence directed at the essence of what it means to be a human being. [7]\nWhy is this? Graeber argues that it is because we need the sense that we are having an appreciable effect on the world. For our life to be spiritually rich and meaningful, we need to feel that we are being a cause in the world. When this is not the case, we lose our moorings.\nUndoing spiritual damage So here are three ways in which our culture of work can cause spiritual damage. It can harm us by setting up a system where non-work is equated with the misery and lack of agency that comes from unemployment. It can harm us by simply wearing us out, so we can\u0026rsquo;t do anything else. And it can harm us by making us engage in tasks that have no benefit, so eroding our sense of ourselves as beings who can have an effect on the world.\nAll three forms of spiritual harm share one characteristic: they undermine our ability to act in the world on the basis of our own creative agency. When we are unemployed, when we are overworked, or when we are forced to engage in a pantomime of useful work knowing all the time that our work is useless, what we have lost is the sense of ourselves as agents in the world, capable of creating something new.\nIf this diagnosis is correct, then it becomes possible to see the outlines of a more humane attitude to work. Perhaps the question we should be asking is not whether work is in itself good (like Carlyle) or bad (like Aristotle). Instead, we should be asking how we can transform our cultures of both work and non-work, so that we build a society that leaves room for agency and creativity for all of us.\nTo do this, we also need to think harder not just about work, but also non-work. So this is what we\u0026rsquo;ll be doing in the next two articles, where we\u0026rsquo;ll ask some deeper questions about two varieties of non-work: play, and idleness.\nQuestions If unemployment is a spiritual harm (in the sense set out above), is this essential to the state of being unemployed? Or is it a result of our cultures of work? Why do you think this?

            "content": "Life Zeno of Elea is another of those shadowy ancient philosophers about whom we know very little. According to some accounts, he was the student of both Parmenides and Xenophanes.\nZeno appears in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Parmenides, where he is visiting Athens together with his teacher. There, the two philosophers meet the young Socrates, upon whom Zeno makes a substantial impression. If Plato\u0026rsquo;s story is true, this would mean that Zeno was born some time around 490 BCE.\nThis is how Plato tells the story:\nParmenides was already quite venerable, very gray but of distinguished appearance, about sixty-five years old. Zeno was at that time close to forty, a tall, handsome man who had been, as rumor had it, the object of Parmenides’ affections when he was a boy. Antiphon said that the two of them were staying with Pythodorus, outside the city wall in the Potters’ Quarter, and that Socrates had come there, along with a number of others, because they were eager to hear Zeno read his book, which he and Parmenides had just brought to Athens for the first time. Socrates was then quite young. [1]\nZeno may have influenced Socrates\u0026rsquo;s approach to philosophical argument. Aristotle later claimed that Zeno invented dialectic—reasoning based on argument and counter-argument. And this process of argument through dialectic was a cornerstone of the method of philosophical questioning developed by Socrates.\nTroubles with tyrants We don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Zeno\u0026rsquo;s life. But as usual, where the historical record fails us, the biographer Diogenes Laërtius steps and fills the void with entertaining stories that may or may not contain a grain of truth.\nAccording to Diogenes\u0026rsquo;s Lives of the Eminent Philosophers, Zeno attempted to overthrow the tyrant Nearchus (or in some accounts, the tyrant Diomedon). He failed and was arrested. Under torture, Zeno refused to reveal his accomplices, but did manage to bite off the tyrant\u0026rsquo;s ear before he was run through with a sword.\nThere are good reasons to be sceptical of this story, not least because it exists in several variants, with different tyrants and different chewed-off body parts. In an alternative account, Zeno bit the tyrant\u0026rsquo;s nose. And in yet another, the tyrant was called Demlyus, and instead of biting off part of the tyrant, Zeno bit off his own tongue and spat it in the tyrant\u0026rsquo;s face.\nPhilosophy Zeno is most famous for his paradoxes. And these paradoxes still have the power to mess with our everyday assumptions about the things like space, time and motion.\nSometimes Zeno\u0026rsquo;s paradoxes are presented as mind-bending puzzles or diversions. But there is serious philosophical intent here. And if we are to understand the rationale behind these paradoxes—and to understand why for Zeno they were more than simple intellectual puzzles—we have to put them in the context of a strange idea proposed by his teacher Parmenides: the idea that nothing ever changes.\nThe illusion of change Parmenides questioned two everyday assumptions we make about the world. The first assumption is that things are plural—that there are many things in the world. And the second assumption is that things are constantly changing.\nBoth of these seem quite reasonable claims. Obviously, there are lots of different things in the world. And obviously, these things undergo change. But Parmenides disagreed. However things may appear to be, Parmenides argued, the reality is this: all of being is made up of one single thing; and this single thing never changes, ever.\nAs we saw in an earlier Philosopher File, according to Parmenides, being as a whole is:\nungenerated and indestructible, whole, of one kind and unwavering, and complete. Nor was it, nor will it be, since now it is, all together, one, continuous. [2]\nThings may seem to change, Parmenides insists, but in reality, they don\u0026rsquo;t (incidentally, Parmenides knows this, because it was a truth revealed to him by a goddess—so how could it not be true?).\nHowever, this leaves us with a problem. If things only seem to change, but in reality don\u0026rsquo;t, how do we account for this seeming? Zeno\u0026rsquo;s paradoxes don\u0026rsquo;t answer this question directly. But they do offer a challenge our everyday perceptions and assumptions. And for Zeno, this undermines our confidence in how things seem to be, giving more weight to the thought that Parmenides might—_just migh_t—be right.\nAchilles and the tortoise Here we\u0026rsquo;ll take just one of Zeno\u0026rsquo;s paradoxes, the famous paradox of Achilles and the tortoise.\nZeno asks us to imagine that Achilles, the Greek hero, is in a race with a tortoise. Achilles is a good sport, and is confident in his own prowess, so he gives the tortoise a little bit of a head start. Then the race begins. Any sensible person betting on the race would put their money on Achilles. Even with that famous heel of his, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty obvious that the athletically inclined hero can outrun a tortoise.\nOr can he? Because Zeno believes he has a knock-down argument to demonstrate that, despite our everyday intuitions, Achilles can never catch up.\nHow can this be?\nImagine that the tortoise starts out at point A. By the time Achilles has reached point A, the tortoise will be a little further ahead at point B. So Achilles continues running, but by the time he has reached point B, the tortoise—bravely striding into the distance—will be at point C. And this process can be repeated to infinity, with Achilles always lagging behind the stolid little tortoise.\nIn the Physics, Aristotle sets out the argument like this:\nThe slowest runner in a race will never be overtaken by the fastest. For the pursuer must first reach the point from which the former started, so that the slower must always be a bit ahead. [3]\nFor Zeno, faithful to his teacher Parmenides, this paradox provides support to the idea that everyday appearances are a poor guide to how things actually are, and to the counterintuitive conclusion that motion is simply an illusion.\nOutrunning Zeno Zeno\u0026rsquo;s paradox is surprisingly hard to think about, and even harder to crack. Since Ancient Greek times, many thinkers have proposed solutions to the paradox. Others, irritated by its intractability, have tried to dismiss it entirely, saying that Zeno is only playing with words.\nBut after two and a half thousand years, the paradox still seems to be frustratingly elusive. Every time you think you\u0026rsquo;ve caught up with what is going on and got hold of an answer, the paradox ambles onwards, just a bit further out of reach, like that damned tortoise.\nIs Zeno\u0026rsquo;s paradox telling us something about the nature of reality? Or is it, as some argue, telling us something about how our intuitions about space, time and motion are wrong?\nI\u0026rsquo;m not going to attempt to set out a solution here: that would involve plunging down rabbit-holes of philosophy, physics and mathematics. So I\u0026rsquo;m going to leave for you to think about yourself, because it can be fun to try and outrun Zeno. And if you are struggling to catch up, have a look at the links below for some possible solutions.\nNotes [1] Parmenides 127b. In John M.

            "title": "7 Ways of Reading Philosophy: #3 Reading self-interestedly",
            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "In the last article in this series on different approaches to reading philosophy, I talked about the rights of the reader to plot a course through whatever they are reading in whatever way they wish—doubling-back, skipping, haphazard and unsystematic, leaving books unfinished.\nA reader who does this might seem, to their more sober peers, to be wilfully irresponsible, or failing in their duties as a reader. But in this article, I want to push the virtues of non-dutiful reading a little further, and I want to argue that one fruitful way of reading philosophy (and, for that matter, anything else) is to read out of self-interest.\nSelf-interest vs. duty We are often suspicious of the idea of self-interest. It seems unrespectable, even blameworthy. And there is a long philosophical tradition that sees self-interest as a profound moral problem. If we act in our own interests, the argument goes, we are by definition not acting fully in the interests of others. And if we are not acting in the interests of others, we are defaulting on our moral duties and obligations.\nOne philosopher who sees a gulf between self-interest and morality is Immanuel Kant. For Kant, acting in accord with our ethical duty involves putting self-interest to one side. Kant is not wholly against self-interest: in his Lectures on Ethics, he says that, “As needy beings the creator gave us self-interest in our own perfection.” [1] Self-interest is a starting point, but for Kant, it is trumped by the disinterested concern for others. In a later lecture, he goes on to say,\nIt is intrinsic to moral perfection, that an action be done without any advantage or self-interest, solely from the concept of duty. [2]\nThis is quite a common view. But it leads us into quite weird territory. In his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant challenges us to imagine somebody who takes satisfaction in spreading joy and happiness among their peers. This is no doubt a good thing; and Kant argues that it is an act in conformity with duty. But this does not necessarily make it a moral act. Why not? Because it is not clear that this act is carried out from a sense of duty. If this person is spreading joy and happiness for the sake of their own satisfaction, Kant maintains, it cannot be said to be a fully moral act.\nKant asks us to imagine the following:\nSuppose, then, that the mind of this philanthropist were overclouded by his own grief, which extinguished all sympathy with the fate of others, and that while he still had the means to benefit others in distress their troubles did not move him because he had enough to do with his own; and suppose that now, when no longer incited to it by any inclination, he nevertheless tears himself out of this deadly insensibility and does the action without any inclination, simply from duty; then the action first has its genuine moral worth. [3]\nThis grief-ridden philanthropist gets no joy from their actions; and so for the first time, as Kant sees it, we can be sure that this person is acting out of duty.\nSalvaging self-interest However, the more you think about this, the weirder it becomes. Is it, in fact, even possible to spread joy and happiness if your actions are performed only from duty?\nThis tendency to see self-interest and duty as somehow opposed has led other philosophers to claim that morality is a sham, and that everything we do is born out of self-interest—however apparently altruistic our acts may seem. If we give money to somebody in need, these gloomy philosophers claim, it is not because we really care about improving their lives. Instead, it is because we want to be seen by our peers (or even by ourselves) as the kind of person who gives money to those in need.\nBut perhaps a degree of self-interest is not such a terrible thing after all. In fact, perhaps self-interest is a necessary component of ethics.\nImagine the following scenario. Down on your luck, you find yourself homeless. Having no other option, you need to beg for money to buy food. On the first day of begging, you meet Mahmoud. He is cheerful and friendly, and he stops to ask how you are. You say you are hungry, so Mahmoud gives you ten dollars. Then he has a chat and goes away with a spring in his step. Mahmoud clearly feels better about life—and about himself—as a result of his generosity. And as you watch him leave, you not only feel good about the ten dollars, but you also feel good that Mahmoud is feeling good.\nThe next day, Miriam stops by. She has been reading Kant all morning, and so when she sees you, she gives you ten dollars, recognising that it is her duty to do so. But, because she is a faithful follower of Kant, she is careful not to derive any pleasure from her gift, out of the fear that this might taint its moral worth. As she leaves (heading back from her lunch break to continue reading more Kant), you watch her departing shoulders, hunched in misery. You feel bad for her. And somehow—for reasons you can\u0026rsquo;t quite put your finger on—you feel worse about life in general.\nIn other words, for a great many altruistic acts, an element of self-interest—an element of feeling good about acting well—makes these acts more worthwhile (and probably more sustainable as well). When Mahmoud gives you ten dollars, he also gives you the gift of knowing that he feels good about his gift. Mahmoud and you both feel better about life. The presence of self-interest turns a dutiful transaction into a win-win situation, one that augments the value of the gift.\nThe self-interested reader There\u0026rsquo;s a lot more I could say about self-interest in general, and why it is really such a bad thing. But what I\u0026rsquo;m interested in here is the idea of what it means to read self-interestedly.\nSelf-interested reading is an approach that side-steps our sense of duty (to ourselves, to others, to the gods of philosophy), and that instead looks for other kinds of pleasure or fulfilment. When reading philosophy, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to feel burdened with a heavy feeling of dutifulness, with the idea that we should read in a particular way, for particular purposes. And, of course, it may be that there are pressing demands on us, demands that we cannot escape: perhaps we are reading Kant because we are studying for exams, and so we have to read him in a particular way to get a good grade. But beyond these instrumental concerns, reading dutifully can also become a habit, particularly when it comes to philosophy. And when we have acquired this habit, we can start to approach all philosophy books with the burdensome sense that we are in the presence of Great Minds, and that our job, lesser mortals that we are, is to submit to this greatness.\nBut reading dutifully risks us forgetting to ask, What\u0026rsquo;s in it for us? And when we forget this question, we risk dulling our sense of life and fun and enjoyment. When we read dutifully, we put our own individuality and our own interests as readers to one side. And if our interests are not at stake when we read, we will be less alert to the possibilities of this new encounter, less lively, our reading less creative.\nSelf-interested reading is in everyone\u0026rsquo;s interest So if you want to get the most out of your reading, perhaps it is in your interests to take your own interests more seriously, and to read self-interestedly. But it is not only in your interests. It is in my interests as well, because when you read with greater self-interest, I too stand to gain.\nThe good thing about self-interested reading is that our interests are all so very different. And this means that the way you read will be different from the way that I read. So, even if we read the same thing, if we read with sufficient self-interest, you will almost inevitably bring things to light that I will miss. You will discover things that I have overlooked. And you will come up with ideas that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t possibly have come up with myself.\nA community of self-interested readers is the kind of community of readers to which I want to belong. Because a community like this is going to be much more richly productive of new ideas and perspectives than a community of dutiful readers. And if we are lucky enough to find ourselves in this kind of community, then when we sit down to talk to our peers about what we have been reading, our conversation will be rooted in the things we care about most, and in the richness of our different experiences of the world.\nSo, the next time you pick up a philosophy book, if you feel that prickling of duty, that sense of obligation to read the book in a particular way, put the book down and take a short break. Then ask yourself, “Why do I want to read this book? Which interests of mine are at stake? What\u0026rsquo;s in it for me?” When you have a clearer idea of what\u0026rsquo;s in it for you, what you want to get out of it, pick the book up again, and get started—alive to the things that matter to you most.\nRead the whole series on seven ways of reading philosophy\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "In this article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to explore the idea that there is something inherently good about work, that work may in some sense be our salvation.\nProbably all of us grumble about our work from time to time. But for all our grumbling, we often see work in itself as a good thing. We praise people for working hard, and we criticise them for slacking off. We tell each other how hard we are working, and when we do, we feel the warm glow of virtue. This is sometimes talked about as a work ethic, the idea that there is something inherently virtuous or improving about work.\nThis is how the 19th-century Scottish philosopher and historian Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) puts it:\nA man perfects himself by working . . . Consider how, even in the meanest sorts of Labour, the whole soul of man is composed into a kind of real harmony, the instant he sets himself to work! Doubt, Desire, Sorrow, Remorse, Indignation, Despair itself, all these like helldogs lie beleaguering the soul of the poor day-worker, as of every man; but he bends himself with free valour against his task, and all these are stilled, all these shrink murmuring far off into their caves. The man is now a man. The blessed glow of Labour in him, is it not purifying fire, wherein all poison is burnt up? [1]\nBut is Carlyle right? Is work really the only thing that can keep the helldogs of doubt, desire, sorrow, remorse, indignation, and despair at bay? And if work is inherently good, how is it good? Where does the goodness of work lie?\nWork! What is it good for? One answer to this question is to say that work is good because it is done for the sake of good things. The goodness lies not in the work itself, but in the ends to which the work is put. So, for example, working in your garden to grow vegetables is a good thing because, if all goes well, you end up with tasty vegetables. And who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like tasty vegetables? Similarly, working in a waged job is good because you need to feed yourself and those close to you.\nIn the first article in this series, we looked at external and internal goods. When we say work is good for the sake of something other than work, what we mean is that work is a means to gaining external goods: food, shelter and so on. In the second piece, we saw how labour is, to some degree, a necessity: we need to sustain ourselves and support our basic needs. And supporting our basic needs is no doubt a good thing.\nBut is work inherently good? In other words, are there internal goods associated with work, simply because it is work? For Carlyle, there certainly are. But not all philosophers agree. Take Aristotle, for example. For Aristotle, the point of work is that it gives us the leisure to contemplate. Work is good only insofar as it can open up spaces where we are free from work. There is no purifying fire of labour in Aristotle. In the Politics (1333a, 30-35), he writes that,\nthe whole of life too is divided into work and leisure, war and peace, and of actions some are necessary or useful, others noble. And the same choice must be made among these as among the parts of the soul and their actions. War must be chosen for the sake of peace, work for the sake of leisure, necessary and useful things for the sake of noble ones. [2]\nWork is good for one thing, and for one thing alone: for providing us with leisure. And only a fool would choose to work for its own sake. For Aristotle, leisure is more choiceworthy than work, because only when we are committed to leisure can we truly flourish.\nLeisured activity is itself held to involve pleasure, happiness, and living blessedly. This is not available to those who are working, however, but only to those who are engaged in leisured activity. [3]\nThe goodness of work But it is not obvious that this is true. And although Carlyle may go too far in celebration of work, any account of work that ignores—as Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account does—the possibility of internal goods fails to do justice to the richness of our experience of work.\nImagine you are a craftsperson in Ancient Greece, and you are making a table. It is hard work. But if you are a good carpenter, as you work—cutting and carving and sanding, delighting in the feel of the wood—you will find yourself experiencing those things that Aristotle aligns with leisure: happiness, pleasure and even a kind of blessedness. As any craftsperson knows, crafting new things can be deeply, humanly satisfying.\nManual labour, too, can be satisfying or enjoyable, even if it is difficult. Several years ago, I was on a Buddhist retreat. One day, during a work period, I was tasked with clearing the sludge from a large pond in the retreat centre grounds. It was hard work, and at first, I found it unpleasant. I was up to my knees in mud, hauling slime from the pond with a rake. I sifted the slime for newts (the newts needed saving and putting back in the water), and then, once the slime was newt-free, took it in a wheelbarrow to be dumped at the bottom of the garden.\nTwo water newts and water plants. Colour line block. Credit: Wellcome Collection. Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nFor the first half-hour, I was miserable. But as I got into it and found my rhythm, I started to relish the ache of my muscles, the feel of the sun on my back, the delight of communing with newts, the creak of the wheelbarrow. Eventually, I realised to my surprise that I was having fun.\nThe moral perils of idleness So work can involve both external goods (putting food on the table) and internal goods (it can be inherently satisfying). But Carlyle is saying more than this. He is not just saying that work involves some internal goods. He is saying that work, insofar as it is work, is in itself a path to virtue. It is a road that leads to purification and even to salvation. The devil, after all, makes work for idle hands; and if we don\u0026rsquo;t work, what will become of us? We will become listless, or—even worse—troublesome.\nChromolithograph Print, The Two Paths, 1890–1910. From six vignettes on the virtues of sobriety, Smithsonian Design Museum via Wikimedia Commons.\nLike many ideas, this idea of work as a path of virtue has deep historical roots. Christian thought has a long history of valuing work and cautioning against idleness. In the Bible, God works to create the world for six days and rests on the seventh. And for many Christian thinkers, this was taken as a model for how we ourselves should lead our lives.\nHere, however, it is important to make a distinction between rest and idleness. Rest is inactivity for the sake of work. It is inactivity so that we can return to work with renewed vigour. But idleness is inactivity instead of work. There is a scriptural sanction for rest. But in the Christian tradition, idleness is often seen as being much more morally problematic.\nOne good example is Benedict of Nursia (480-547), whose Rule of St. Benedict was one of the foundational texts for the Christian monastic tradition. In his Rule, Benedict repeatedly talks about work as a sacred duty, and idleness as a dereliction of this duty. In chapter 48, Benedict writes,\nIdleness is the enemy of the soul. Therefore, the brothers should have specified periods for manual labour as well as for prayerful reading. [4]\nFor Benedict, work is good for the soul. Here, Benedict is elevating internal goods (the inner moral improvement the comes from work) over external goods (the usefulness of work in terms of external concerns). Benedict notes that even those who are afflicted by sickness or old age should have tasks assigned to them, so that they can avoid the spiritual peril of idleness.\nBrothers who are sick or weak should be given a type of work or craft that will keep them busy without overwhelming them or driving them away. [5]\nWe\u0026rsquo;re all monks now: vocation universalised In his 1905 essay Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (later translated into English as The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), the sociologist Max Weber writes that Benedict\u0026rsquo;s rule was an attempt to comprehensively refashion human life according to rational principles. The life of Benedict\u0026rsquo;s monks was governed by a regulated pattern of work, prayer, and activity that could free them from their own irrational whims and desires.\nThe aim was thus to train the monk—objectively speaking—to be a worker in the service of the kingdom of God, and so also—subjectively speaking—to ensure the salvation of his soul. [6]\nAs far as Benedict was concerned, this idea of work as salvation was restricted to those who had a religious vocation. But in his essay, Weber explores how in later European history, this notion of vocation (in the original German, Weber uses the term Beruf, which can mean both \u0026ldquo;occupation\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;calling\u0026rdquo;) became universalised.\nToday many of us may think that we have—or should have—a sense of vocation. We say to ourselves it is our vocation to be a writer, an artist, a nurse, a digital asset manager or whatever. This idea of vocation as something we all should have, Weber argues, goes back to the German theologian Martin Luther (1483-1546).\nLuther\u0026rsquo;s innovation was to see vocation as something that was not the sole concern of monks, but instead of anybody at all. For the theologian, “vocation is the work of faith; vocation is worship in the realm of the world.” [7]\nPortrait of Luther 1546, the Workshop of Lucas Cranach the Younger. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThis universalised notion of vocation undermined the justification for monasticism. If we all have a vocation and if all work is a path to salvation, then why be a monk?\nBut in a more subtle sense, this universalised vocation turned us all into monastics of a sort. If all work is about vocation, if all work is about a calling to participate in God\u0026rsquo;s work, then, like Benedict\u0026rsquo;s monks, we are all obliged to spend our days in labour, to rest only so that we can work more and work better, and to shun idleness as an affliction of the soul.\nOf monks and CEOs As this Protestant work ethic developed, Weber claims, the accumulation of wealth came to itself be seen as a sign of virtuous diligence: but only, paradoxically, if the person who was accumulating this wealth did not enjoy it for its own sake. Weber writes,\nWealth is thus bad ethically only in so far as it is a temptation to idleness and sinful enjoyment of life, and its acquisition is bad only when it is with the purpose of later living merrily and without care. But as a performance of duty in a calling it is not only morally permissible, but actually enjoined. [8]\nIt is a strange idea, but it is an idea that is still with us. One particular manifestation of this idea can be found in that curious contemporary hero, celebrated so frequently in the business press: the billionaire CEO who—while accumulating great wealth—lives a simple, monastic life, following a routine of work, restricted diet, exercise, and meditation.\nIt is a curious vision of the good life. And it is almost, but not quite, a lifestyle of which Benedict himself would have approved. But there\u0026rsquo;s nothing inevitable about this idea of work as a kind of salvation, this sense of monastic duty that hangs over us as we work, or this bizarre notion that the accumulation of wealth has a moral dimension—but only if we do not profit overly from the wealth we accumulate.\nSo in next week\u0026rsquo;s article, we\u0026rsquo;ll ask whether work is really the path to virtue after all.\nQuestions Think about a time when you have engaged in hard, physical work. Was it enjoyable? Did it make you a better person? If so, how? Is there something good about all work, beyond the more obvious external goods (the results of work, income etc.) and internal goods (enjoyment, pleasure etc.) that work might involve? Is idleness morally dangerous? If so, why? Do you see yourself as having a vocation? If you do, what is your vocation? And how do you pursue it?

            "content": "Understanding the world The story of philosophy is the story of human attempts to understand the world of which we are a part, and to understand ourselves. But traditions of academic philosophy have tended to give greater weight to only a small handful of traditions — for example, Greek and European philosophy, Indian philosophy or Chinese philosophy.\nBut if philosophy is really about human attempts to understand the world, and to understand what it means to be human, then if we limit ourselves to a few traditions, we risk missing out on rich resources. As the African philosopher, Ptahhotep, wrote almost four and a half thousand years ago, the emeralds of wisdom can be found everywhere.\nSo recently, philosophers have started to ask about traditions of philosophy from other parts of the globe: traditions that may be just as subtle and as rich as the ones that are traditionally taught in philosophy courses. And one such set of traditions is that of Maya philosophy.\nPhilosophy Reconstructing Maya philosophy In his book on Maya philosophy, Alexus McLeod writes that “Mesoamerican thought […] has been uniquely neglected by philosophers” (p. xx). One reason for this is the patchiness of the textual tradition. European colonialism was ruinous for Maya culture, and thus for the continuity of the Maya philosophical tradition. Consequently, many texts from the pre-Colombian era have not survived, or have survived only in fragmentary form.\nScholars usually divide Maya history into three eras. The Preclassic era extends from the second millennium BCE to the first stone inscriptions that appear around 250 CE. During this period, there was a slow growth of urbanization, and a corresponding rise in social and bureaucratic complexity. The Classic era runs from 250 to 900 CE, and marks the height of the southern Maya highland city-states. And then the Postclassic era—when the centre of power shifts north to the Yucatán—runs from 900 CE to the beginnings of the Spanish colonial era. The printed texts we do have come from the Postclassic era and after (although there are stone inscriptions and carvings from the earlier Classic era).\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s no reason that this patchiness of the textual record should hold us back from taking Maya thought seriously and working hard to reconstruct it. We know about the Presocratic philosophers of the Greek world—people like Thales, Anaxagoras Pythagoras—based on fragments and reconstructions, rather than on complete texts. And if we still take these thinkers seriously as philosophers, there\u0026rsquo;s no reason not to do the same with Maya thought.\nThe trouble with time All philosophical traditions have their own distinctive preoccupations: and if there is one central preoccupation in Maya philosophy, this preoccupation is time.\nWithin Maya philosophy, time is central to any understanding of the world and to ourselves. For the Maya philosophers, time is not just the element we swim in. It is not just something to which we are subject. Instead, the Maya maintain that human activity actively fashions time. And in fashioning time, we help to fashion existence as a whole.\nAccording to the Maya understanding of time, creation is not a one-time thing. Instead, it is an ongoing process in which we participate by giving shape to time. This is illustrated beautifully by the Popol Vuh, probably the most famous of all Maya texts.\nThe Popul Vuh is a mythological and philosophical text of the Kʼicheʼ people first written down in the middle of the 16th century. At the beginning of the book, the gods are struggling to create human beings. They make several attempts. First they create animals and birds, but these creatures are incapable of speech. Then they make creatures out of mud, but they dissolve when they are wet. Next, they fashion effigies made of wood. By now, they are having some limited success. The creatures they make certainly look like people and speak like people. Like people, they are even capable of reproducing. But, the Popol Vuh says, these creatures continue to disappoint their creators. They are brittle and rigid. They have no sense of purpose and, crucially, they are incapable of “keeping the days.” Incapable of actively fashioning time, these proto-humans are incapable of participating in the ongoing processes of creation.\nSo the gods get rid of these botched humans and try for a fourth time, fashioning their new creations out of maize. And at last, the gods hit it lucky. These new human beings can speak and reproduce, but they can also give shape to time. And in ordering time, they can participate in creating and recreating the world to which they belong.\nOrdering time But what does it mean to give shape to time? In the traditions of Maya thought, this ongoing creation is referred to as tz’ak, or “ordering.” Human activity puts the world, and time, in order. Without this process of human ordering, the universe would remain in a state of chaos.\nFor the Maya, the keeping of calendars is essential to this ordering, and thus to giving shape to our collective lives. McLeod makes an analogy with our present-day ordering of time:\nWe can think of this in terms of the way that companies, for example, define their “calendric” systems. In making Monday to Friday 9am–5pm, with a 12–1pm lunch break, for example, the standard business schedule, companies we work for order our experiences and create the boundaries within which we live and must think of our own lives and experience. 9 to 5 on the weekdays becomes “work time,” distinct from the “rest time” after 5, or the “enjoyment time” on the weekend.Philosophy of the Ancient Maya (pp. 25-6)\nThis ordering of time is not just personal. It is also collective and political. The ruler orders the city-state through shaping how time is ordered within the state, and through shaping how time is experienced. And one way that this happens is through ritual.\nRitual and the shaping of time Think of an ordinary everyday ritual, like making a cup of tea the same way each morning, and drinking it in bed. This ritual gives rise to a very specific sense of time. If you repeat this ritual every day (and if you don\u0026rsquo;t, you should), you soon find that the ritual seems to gather together your mornings so that experientially, every morning is closely bound with every other. Yesterday morning, this morning and tomorrow morning feel like they are part of a single time. In a real, experiential sense, as you sit in bed drinking tea, this morning, tomorrow morning and yesterday morning feel experientially closer than the meeting you have at 11am, or the errands you have to run before you get to the meeting (and this is what can make the experience of drinking tea in bed so deliciously timeless).\nEven the simplest of rituals shapes our overall sense of time like this. Ritual gives time a particular, specific quality and rhythm, and thus it shapes the pattern of our lives. You could see human existence as a patchwork of different, overlapping experiences of time, shaped by the rituals in which we engage, individually and collectively.\nWhen you start to see how even the smallest rituals play a role in giving shape to our sense of time, you can begin to see the force of the broader Maya philosophical claim that ritual is one of the primary ways of ordering time, and thus one of the ways that human beings give order to the universe. As McLeod puts it:\nThe ritual actions of humans play a role in the continual creation of the cosmos. The gods create the patterns and the original stuff of the world, which is then molded, manifested, and sustained by humanity Philosophy of the Ancient Maya (p. 31)\nThis is one reason that Maya philosophy is compelling, and can still speak to us today. It tells us that the world we inherit is only partially formed, that it is a creation still in progress. And it tells us that it is up to us to take this raw material, and through our own rituals, to continually reshape it, so we can work continually on creating the world afresh.\nFurther Reading Books The field of Maya philosophy is still very young.

            "content": "What is work? And how can we think better about work? Like many other things, we more or less know what work is when we don\u0026rsquo;t think about it too hard. But when we try to think a bit more deeply, or a bit more systematically, it becomes harder to figure out. So in this piece, we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at the philosopher Hannah Arendt, whose exploration of the vita activa, or “the active life”, is a useful way to start getting a handle on the role that work plays in human life.\nWho was Hannah Arendt? In her book The Human Condition, Arendt contrasts the vita contemplativa, or “the contemplative life”, and the vita activa, or the “active life.” For Arendt, human life involves both contemplation and activity. And this dual commitment to both thinking and doing was reflected in her own life. Arendt was not only a political theorist and a philosopher, but she was also an educator and an activist who engaged actively in politics.\nHannah Arendt was born in Hanover, Germany in 1906. She studied with some of the most significant philosophers working in Germany during the first half of the 20th century. After studying at the University of Marburg with Martin Heidegger, she briefly enrolled in classes with Edmund Husserl, the founder of the movement in philosophy called phenomenology, a rich philosophical tradition that explores the textures and structures of human experience. Arendt then wrote her PhD in Heidelberg under the supervision of the philosopher Karl Jaspers. Her thesis, completed in 1926, was on the concept of love in the work of the philosopher Saint Augustine.\nBy this time, Anti-Semitism was on the rise in Germany. And Arendt, who was herself Jewish, realised that a future in Germany was increasingly unviable. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933, she fled—first to Prague, and then to Paris. In Paris, she worked for several Jewish refugee organisations until the outbreak of the Second World War. She was briefly imprisoned in 1941, after which Arendt fled France, this time to New York.\nIn New York, Arendt continued to write and teach, eventually settling and becoming a US citizen. She published The Human Condition in 1958.\nArendt in 1958, the year The Human Condition was published. CC BY-SA 4.0.Münchner Stadtmuseum, Sammlung Fotografie, Archiv Barbara Niggl Radloff\nAlthough she held several visiting positions at universities both in the US and globally, Arendt resisted the temptation to take on a tenured role in a university preferring the freedom of combining writing, teaching, politics and other work. Arendt died in New York in 1975, her book The Life of the Mind, the sequel to which she saw as a part of the same project as The Human Condition, still unfinished.\nContemplation and activity The Greek philosopher Aristotle saw the vita contemplativa as the ultimate aim of human life. For Aristotle, theōria or contemplation was far more important than praxis or practical activity (see the article here). In other words, the ultimate justification of practical activity was that it should help support contemplation. Doing better is valuable, Aristotle claims, only to the extent that it helps us with thinking better.\nThese days, however, we are likely to see things in reverse. If we seem like we are getting too theoretical, people are likely to call us out and say, “That\u0026rsquo;s all fine, but what practical use is any of this?” What matters for us is action rather than contemplation. Our own position, in other words, is the precise opposite of that of Aristotle: the ultimate purpose of thinking better is doing better.\nFor Arendt, this reversal of the hierarchy between thinking and doing is one of the most important transformations in Western thought.\nPerhaps the most momentous of the spiritual consequences of the discoveries of the modern age [\u0026hellip;] has been the reversal of the hierarchical order between the vita contemplativa and the *vita activa.* [1]\nPerhaps the most famous example of this reversal is in the work of Karl Marx. In his Theses on Feuerbach, Marx complains that we are too hung up on contemplation and insufficiently attentive to “sensuous human activity.” And he challenges us to ask what it would be to think about human life not just as something to theorise about, but instead as something that we can actively shape. Marx ends his Theses with the famous claim that:\nThe philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it. [2]\nThinking differently about the world is all very well. But for Marx, the ultimate justification of philosophy lies in whether it allows us to behave differently, or to act differently.\nSeeing human being whole For Aristotle, there is a hierarchy between thinking and doing, with thinking having the upper hand. Marx turns this hierarchy upside down and says that doing should have the upper hand. For Arendt, however, the problem is the hierarchy itself. Instead of seeing the vita contemplativa and the vita activa as existing in a hierarchical relationship, she claims that we should instead see them as different aspects of human life.\nOne reason that Arendt resists these hierarchies is that once you have a hierarchy like this, you commit yourself to the idea that there is one ultimate principle of human life. And when you have decided that human life is governed by a single principle, you have to make everything else fall into line around this principle.\nThis not only narrows the scope of human life, but also muddies our thinking. Many things matter in human life. Contemplation is good, in and of itself. But likewise, digging the garden is good. So is making a chair out of wood, or baking a cake, or putting on a play. There are many different good things. And if you try to gather them together under a single principle, you miss the complexity and the diversity of human life. So in resisting these hierarchies, Arendt wanted to open the door to seeing human being whole, so that we can start to understand human life in its complexity and its messiness.\nAnatomising the vita activa In The Human Condition, Arendt asks what it means for human beings to act. She defines the vita activa as “human life in so far as it is actively engaged in doing something.” We are not beings who just sit and contemplate. We also do stuff. But human activity is very diverse, so to get a handle on this diversity, Arendt divides this activity into three broad categories: “labour”, “work” and “action.”\nWith the term vita activa, I propose to designate three fundamental human activities: labor, work, and action. They are fundamental because each corresponds to one of the basic conditions under which life on earth has been given to man. [3]\nLabour At the most fundamental level, we need to provide for our bodily, biological needs. We need to feed ourselves. We need fresh water. We need shelter. Arendt calls this struggle to meet our biological needs labour.\nImagine you are marooned on a desert island. Fortunately, the island has an abundance of good fresh fruit, tasty tubers, and flavoursome rodents to feast on. In the centre of the island is a small spring that provides fresh water. You have everything you need. But to sustain your daily life in this little paradise, you have to put in the time. You have to pick those fruits, dig up those tubers, chase down those rodents, and go back and forth to the spring to gather water. This is what Arendt means by labour.\nBefore you live too long on your desert island, you realise that the thing about labour is that it is never-ending and interminable. If you want to go on surviving, we have to keep on digging up tubers and chasing down rodents and carrying water.\nFor Arendt, this means that at some very basic level, we are not free. We are bound to our biological needs, and as these needs will continue as long as we live, so too will the need for labour.\nRobinson Crusoe. From Aunt Louisa\u0026rsquo;s Oft Told Tales (1870). Via Wikimedia Commons.\nWork The trouble with labour is that it is cyclical. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t go anywhere. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t build anything for the future. It just keeps you ticking along. But human beings also act on the world not just to meet their needs, but to reshape the world, so it can better provide for them. This is what Arendt calls work. Work is about producing something—a result—that will continue to endure in the world after the work is done.\nThrough work, we don\u0026rsquo;t just sustain our survival. Instead, we turn the world into a world that is partly human-made. We create objects and institutions that endure. If on your desert island, you decide to build a little hut to live in, then that is work. You spend a few days building, and at the end of it, your world is slightly different from how it was before.\nArendt complains that past thinkers have obscured the distinction between labour and work. They have seen the activity of digging for tubers and the activity of building a hut as the same thing. But work is not just about bare survival. It is about bringing something new into being. Once you have reshaped the world through work, you have won for yourself a degree of freedom. You can sit in your new hut, snug and cosy, and enjoy the benefits of your new shelter, long after the work is done.\nArendt herself knows that the boundary between labour and work is blurred. There are ongoing tasks to sustain the products of your work—the roof needs fixing from time to time—and none of the objects that we fabricate is entirely durable. But the products of our work are capable of outlasting us. And for this reason, work, unlike labour, has a social dimension. If you get rescued from that desert island, it won\u0026rsquo;t matter to the next castaway that you have laboured to pick and eat fruit. But the house you have worked on will still be standing, and the new castaway can move in.\nAction The third kind of activity that Arendt explores is action. Action is profoundly social. Action is what happens when we come together in society with others, each of us with our own uniqueness, our own talents, our own qualities, and our own concerns, and we try to work out how to refashion our shared world.\nIf the active life was only about labour and work, nothing would ever change. We\u0026rsquo;d just keep on remaking the world in the same way as it had always been. Work just replicates the same structures again and again. But action is where change starts to happen. Action is about acting in society with others to change the structures of which we are a part. And this process is fundamentally social. There is no action, Arendt argues, in isolation. There is no action for our castaway.\nAction is also where we are most free. When we are labouring, we are caught up in necessity. We are subject to our bodily needs and unfree. When we are working, we free ourselves to some extent from these needs by reshaping the world so that we can enjoy a degree of freedom. But our freedom is still limited. We are still a part of the world that we have inherited, and all of its structures.\nIt is only when we engage in action that we start to reshape, reimagine and reinvent our shared world. Action is when we say, “Hey, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be like this. How about we do it this way instead?” Or it is when we take to the streets to protest. Or it is when we get together to rethink our shared world.\nStanisław Osostowicz - Antifascist Demonstration (1932-1933). Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nGiving birth to new worlds One way of thinking about this is by thinking in terms of what Arendt calls “natality.” Philosophers are often preoccupied with mortality, by the fact that human beings die. But they pay less attention to the way that human beings give birth to new things and new worlds. Natality is about the every-present possibility of change. It is about the way we can together give birth to newness in the world.\nLabour and work, as well as action, are also rooted in natality in so far as they have the task to provide and preserve the world for, to foresee and reckon with, the constant influx of newcomers who are born into the world as strangers.\nHowever, of the three, action has the closest connection with the human condition of natality; the new beginning inherent in birth can make itself felt in the world only because the newcomer possesses the capacity of beginning something anew, that is, of acting. In this sense of initiative, an element of action, and therefore of natality, is inherent in all human activities.\nMoreover, since action is the political activity par excellence, natality, and not mortality, may be the central category of political, as distinguished from metaphysical, thought. [4]\nFor Arendt, this is the highest question of the vita activa. How do we transform the world? What new worlds do we want to give birth to? And when we are asking these questions, we are at our most free.\nDiscussion questions Arendt argues that in the modern era, we have reversed the traditional hierarchy between thinking and doing. What is most important to us these days is action rather than contemplation. But is Arendt right about this? Or do we still value contemplation more highly? In your own vita activa, how much of your activity is labour, how much is work, and how much is action? Can philosophy help contribute to what Arendt calls “action”—in other words, to changing the structures of which we are a part? If so, how? Philosophers think a lot about mortality, the fact that we all die. But how might it change our approach to philosophy if we thought more about natality—the fact that we are all capable of creating new things in the world?

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life The philosopher Mo Di, more commonly known as Mozi (or “Master Mo”) lived sometime between the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. Although we don\u0026rsquo;t have a great deal of information about Mozi as an individual, the evidence suggests he was born, as was Confucius, in the state of Lu. Many later writers have suggested that he came from the artisan class, and thus was something of an outsider to the high society of Warring States China.\nPhilosophy as carpentry It has been suggested that Mozi was a wheelwright or a carpenter. The idea that he was a craftsman is attractive. As with Socrates over in Greece, this suggests that he might have been a thinker who knew something about practicality, who knew how to do stuff other than just philosophising.\nIt is certainly true that Mozi uses metaphors of craft in his writing to talk about the practice of philosophy. He uses the metaphor of the wheelwright\u0026rsquo;s compasses and the carpenter\u0026rsquo;s square as metaphors for what he calls “the intention of heaven” (tian zhi). But it is also clear that Mozi was conversant with the teachings of Confucius, and with the literary traditions of his time, and there are suggestions that he acted as an adviser to rulers. The translator Ian Johnston weighs up the evidence and concludes that:\nGiven the prominence of the school, the most plausible account of his life is that it was passed in travelling and teaching, with perhaps occasional periods in some official position in a particular state.‌‌‌‌The Mozi: A Complete Translation, p. 21\nWhatever the case, it is generally agreed that Mozi died in advanced old age, some time at the end of the fifth century BCE, or the beginning of the fourth century BCE.\nPhilosophy The tradition of philosophy initiated by Mozi is known in English as Mohism. The teachings of this tradition are collected together in a book simply known as the Mozi, which was compiled by the philosopher\u0026rsquo;s followers. The doctrines at the heart of Mohism were tian zhi or “the intention of heaven” and jian ai, which is usually translated as “universal love” or “inclusive care.”\nDuring the centuries after Mozi\u0026rsquo;s death, Mohist philosophy was widespread and popular. The Confucian philosopher Mencius grumbled that “The doctrines of Yang Zhu and Mozi fill the world.”\nBut with the rise of the Han dynasty, Confucianism took centre stage, and Mohism went into decline. Nevertheless, of the seventy-one books of the original Mozi, fifty-eight still survive in one form or another.\nThe intention of heaven For Mozi, the idea of the intention of heaven is the idea that the universe is, at the most fundamental level, morally constructed. Mozi argues that righteousness (you yi) is productive, contributing to the life of the world, while unrighteousness (wu yi) is unproductive. The world is constituted in such a way that rapaciousness, absence of care for others, and greed lead inevitably to “death”—to poverty, disorder and chaos.\nHow do I know that Heaven desires righteousness and abhors unrighteousness? I say that when the world is righteous, it \u0026ldquo;lives\u0026rdquo;, and when it is not righteous, it \u0026ldquo;dies\u0026rdquo;. When it is righteous, it is rich. When it is not righteous, it is poor. When it is righteous, it is well ordered. When it is not righteous, it is disordered. So then, Heaven desires its (the world’s) \u0026ldquo;life\u0026rdquo; and abhors its \u0026ldquo;death\u0026rdquo;. It desires its wealth and abhors its poverty. It desires its order and abhors its disorder. This is how I know that Heaven desires righteous and abhors unrighteousness.‌‌‌‌The Mozi: A Complete Translation, p. 235\nThis means that the task of a good ruler is to rule in accord with the underlying moral tendencies of the universe, to bring about a just and moral system of government.\nUniversal love This idea of the intention of heaven links in closely with one of the Mohists most famous doctrines, that of “universal love.” The term “universal love” or “inclusive care” is shorthand for a longer, more telling slogan: jian xiang ai, jiao xiang li, or “universal mutual love, connected mutual benefit.”\nFor the Mohists, benefit does not have to be a zero-sum game. It is possible to build a society that is characterised by universal mutual love and care, a society that will benefit all equally. Such a society is in accord with the intention of heaven. This makes it the maximally functional (or minimally dysfunctional) form of society. The Mozi puts it as follows:\nUndoubtedly what Heaven desires is that there be mutual love and mutual benefit among people. What it does not desire is that there be mutual hatred and mutual harm among people‌‌‌‌.The Mozi: A Complete Translation_, p. 27_\nFor Mozi, the hallmark of this absence of care is a concern for one\u0026rsquo;s own benefit to the detriment of others. But when you balance a care for all equally, you are in accord with the intention of heaven.\nLove, punishment and war The Confucians objected to all this. They argued that partiality is not a flaw, but is instead central to human care. The Confucian argument is that it is right and proper that we are more partial to our family than we are to strangers. This is not a shortcoming or a moral lapse. Instead, it is a guarantor of order. Within Confucianism, social order is based upon a network of interlocking relationships of care, each of different intensity.\nThe Confucian view makes some degree of psychological sense: we naturally care more for those closest to us. If all is well, we don\u0026rsquo;t usually need to be told to care for those who are in our circle of intimates. Our caring for them is spontaneous, unlike our caring for those who are more distant from us.\nBut this differential care also brings problems in its wake. One such problem is nepotism, the overlooking of faults in those close to us, and the favouring of those with whom we have closer links (if you want to read more, read this piece on whether you should take your father to court for stealing a sheep). For the Mohists, this partiality is problematic. And universal love is the way to go.\nBut even if we accept the Mohist argument for universal caring, the question is this: how do we put in place a society characterised by this kind of universal love?\nLove and force It is at this point that the Mozi makes an uncomfortable suggestion. To establish a society based on universal love, what is required is a system of sagely rule that impartially rewards impartiality, and equally impartially punishes partiality.\nNow things like universal mutual love and the exchange of mutual benefit are both beneficial and easy to practise in innumerable ways. I think it is only a matter of not having a ruler who delights in them, and that is all.If there was a ruler who delighted in these things, and encouraged people with rewards and praise, and intimidated them with penalties and punishments, I think the people would take to universal mutual love and interchange of mutual benefit just like fire goes up and water goes down and cannot be stopped in the world.”‌‌‌‌The Mozi: A Complete Translation_, p. 163-5_\nIt might seem, at first glance, that the Mohists\u0026rsquo; concern with universal love would translate into a kind of pacifism. But nothing could be further from the truth.\nInstead, Mozi himself is said to have advised on military strategy; and the Mozi contains chapters on defensive warfare: from fortifications to walls and gates to weapons. Because if anything is worth protecting, as far as the Mohists are concerned, then it is universal love. Universal love might be a worthy goal. But the Mohist admission that it needs to be underwritten by intimidation raises uncomfortable questions about its viability.\nFurther Reading Books The quote from Mencius comes from Bryan Van Norden\u0026rsquo;s translation, Mengzi: With Selections from Traditional Commentaries (Hackett 2008), p. 88.\nIan Johnstone\u0026rsquo;s The Mozi: A Complete Translation (The Chinese University Press 2010) is beautifully readable and comes with the Chinese text.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Welcome Welcome to the latest Looking for Wisdom philosophy course, where we\u0026rsquo;ll be exploring the philosophy of work.\nWe spend much of our lives working, and much of the time when we are not working, we spend talking about work, recovering from work, fretting about work, or wondering if we should work more or work less. But what is work? Why does it loom so large in our lives? And how can philosophy help throw more light on what work is, and why it matters?\nWhat is work? In his book on the philosophy of work, Lars Svendsen says that work, at the most fundamental level, is about acting on the external world so that “one can get the necessities of life.”[1] You work hard in the garden, turning over the soil and planting your seeds in neat rows. And sometime in the future, you will be able to feast on the crops you have planted.\nMelon farmer, from c. 1370. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThis means that work is not just about getting the necessities of life here and now. It is not merely a matter of shaping the world in the present. It is also about our relationship with the future. It is about making sure we continue to get the things we need, in an uncertain world. As the Book of Proverbs in the Old Testament says, it is perhaps wise to put in work now, so that our future will be one of greater ease: “He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding” (Proverbs 12:11).\nBut if work is about attaining external goods—both in the immediate term and also in the future—it is not just about this. Many of our preoccupations around work are related to internal goods. These are the kinds of questions that worry us: Is our work meaningful? Is it satisfying? Is it enjoyable? Does it meet our hunger for status? What does it do in terms of our need for a particular identity, a particular kind of role in the world?\nExternal and internal goods do not always align. And this often makes our relationship with work a complex one. Do we take the higher-paying but lower-status job? Or do we take the lower-paying but higher-status job? How do we manage the trade-off between material security and a more meaningful life? What if our work is fun, just the right level of stretching, and materially beneficial, but at the same time harmful to others? Can it still be called good work?\nIn the sweat of thy face: the origins of work We are used to thinking these kinds of questions are integral to human existence. And in contemporary societies, perhaps they are. But according to some accounts, our current preoccupation with work has not always been with us.\nMany ancient myths talk about a time before human beings needed to work. In the Old Testament Book of Genesis, the first humans live in a state of innocence and leisure, plucking fruit from the trees and in harmony with the other creatures of the world. But a fatal act of disobedience leads to their expulsion from paradise, and to the curse of work:\ncursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.[2]\nGreek mythology also looks back to a charmed Golden Age. In his Works and Days, written around the turn of the seventh century BCE, Hesiod tells the following story about the first human beings, who lived in a state of abundance, and did not have to wrestle what they needed from the soil:\nThey had good things galore; a bumper yield Of corn sprung volunteering from the field. They shared the harvest, peaceful as you please, And gentle, willing, dwelt in bounteous ease.[3]\nIf both Greek and Biblical traditions see work as a symptom of decline, a fall from an earlier state of grace, the Chinese tradition takes the opposite view.\nFor the philosopher Mencius (372–289 BCE), early humans lived in a state not of primal abundance, but of primal lack. In the time of the ancients, Mencius says, grain did not ripen, the terrain was covered in thickets of trees and shrubs and the people were at the mercy of wild animals. So the sage-kings imposed order on the land. They removed the underbrush, channelled the rivers, and thereby opened up space for agriculture, teaching people how to cultivate grain.[4]\nTao Hong, Returning Peasants in a Spring Evening (1600s). Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nAn original affluent society? These stories may all contain an element of collective folk memory. For most of our history, our ancestors were hunter-gatherers. Before the coming of civilisation, human beings lived in small groups, hunting and foraging for food and their daily necessities. This may seem like a strenuous way to go about making a living. But the evidence suggests otherwise.\nThe idea that people in hunter-gatherer societies work less than those who live in settled agricultural societies goes back to the mid-1960s when the anthropologist Marshall Sahlins first talked about hunter-gatherer society as “the original affluent society.” In his 1972 book Stone-Age Economics, Sahlins wrote that:\nA good case can be made that hunters and gatherers work less than we do; and, rather than a continuous travail, the food quest is intermittent, leisure abundant, and there is a greater amount of sleep in the daytime per capita per year than in any other condition of society.[5]\nOver the decades since Sahlins first proposed the idea of the original affluent society, many anthropologists have challenged his view, arguing that it is more a reflection of our romantic view of the past—playing into Biblical and Classical myths—than it is a reflection of reality. And there are certainly downsides to the hunter-gatherer way of life: scarcity, the risk of violence, high infant mortality, and disease.\nNevertheless, several decades after Sahlins first talked about the original affluent society, contemporary anthropological data tends to broadly support the claim that hunting and gathering cultures tend to work less. Recent research among the Agta people in the Philippines, for example, also suggests that the move from hunting and gathering to farming leads to a net increase in work.\nBut also, in hunter-gatherer societies, the boundaries between work and non-work may be more thinly drawn. Among the Agta, leisure time plays an important social role. Time spent hanging out, chatting, making jokes is not just downtime. It also plays a vital role in refining, sharing and handing on sophisticated cultural knowledge that allows that Agta to flourish in their particular niche.[6] Leisure, in this sense, helps sustain the existence of the Agta as much as work.\nThe invention of hierarchy One additional consequence of the move from hunter-gatherer societies to settled agricultural societies—and to the towns, cities and civilisations that followed—was the invention of hierarchy.\nHunter-gatherer societies are often markedly egalitarian. They don\u0026rsquo;t exhibit the same static hierarchies that settled communities do. But once communities settle, and in greater numbers, hierarchies tend to emerge—according to the increasingly specialised work that people do, according to gender, or according to the wealth that people have managed to accumulate.\nOver in China, Mencius argued that the ordering of the world into well-functioning societies necessitated a kind of hierarchy. And this meant a division between those who laboured with their hearts (or their minds—the Chinese character xin means both) by governing others, and those who laboured with their strength, and who were themselves governed:\nit is said, \u0026ldquo;Some labour with their hearts; some labour with their strength. Those who labour with their hearts rule others; those who labour with their strength are governed by others.\u0026rdquo; Those who are governed by others feed others; those who govern others are fed by others. This is the righteousness common to the world.[7]\nContemplation, leisure and slavery Mencius splits the idea of work into two. On the one hand, there is intellectual work or the activity of the mind. And on the other hand, there is physical work, or the activity of the body. This was a division that was made with similar starkness over in Greece, with Mencius\u0026rsquo;s contemporary, Aristotle (384–322 BCE).\nAristotle sees human activity hierarchically: at the top of the hierarchy is theōria, or contemplation. Below this is praxis, or practical activity, which for Aristotle encompasses both politics and ethics. And below this, there is technē, or craft (see the article here), and the bodily labour performed by slaves.\nFor Aristotle, there is an inherent dignity and goodness to thinking. But there is little inherent dignity to be found in craft, or in physical labour. The purpose of physical work, as far as Aristotle is concerned, is to provide leisure. And if you can get somebody else to work so that you can have more leisure, then so be it.\nThis leads to Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s notorious support for the institution of slavery. He justifies slavery with the deeply problematic claim that some of us are naturally slaves, while some of us are naturally rulers. In the Politics, Aristotle writes:\nFor if something is capable of rational foresight, it is a natural ruler and master, whereas whatever can use its body to labour is ruled and is a natural slave. That is why the same thing is beneficial for both master and slave. [8]\nGreek slaves working in a mine. 5th Century BCE. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe claim of mutual benefit seems puzzling. But for Aristotle, if intellectual pursuits—born out of leisure—are the highest end for human life, slavery gives the slave (who is naturally not given to contemplation) a way of participating in this highest end.\nSlavery was deeply embedded in Greek society. But Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s defence of the institution is not without unease. He argues that slavery is a just institution, but then he makes a reversal and says that those who claim the opposite, and say it is unjust, are “right, up to a point.” But if Aristotle recognises slavery as an injustice, at least to some extent, as Svendsen writes, “he took [it] to be a necessary injustice. He seemed to think: somebody has to do the dirty work, and it had better not be me.”[9]\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s conclusions are deeply unpalatable. But even today, how we think about work is deeply entangled with questions of hierarchy. And this raises all kinds of uncomfortable questions about the kind of work we and others do, how different kinds of work are rewarded, and how our own comforts may ultimately depend on the discomfort of others.\nThinking through work There is nothing straightforward about our attitudes to work. Work involves balancing external goods (putting food on the table, bringing in the harvest) and internal goods (fulfilment, well-being, fun). It is mixed up with questions of hierarchy, status and how we divide up tasks in our complex societies. And it raises contentious questions about the value of the work we and others do. Are different kinds of work different in dignity? How do we think about the relationship between the work of the heart/mind, and the labour of strength? Does work ennoble us? And if so, what kind of work? Or does all work minimise us? Should leisure be seen as the goal of human life, as Aristotle might have it? Or should we see the Aristotelian leisured classes as parasites?\nOver the next few weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ll be exploring all of these questions. We\u0026rsquo;ll be rethinking the hierarchy between contemplation and labour. We\u0026rsquo;ll be exploring the dignity and the drudgery of work. We\u0026rsquo;ll be asking questions about the opposites of work: idleness, leisure and play. And we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking into our crystal balls to ask about work holds for us in the future.\nHave a look at the course outline below to see a sketch of the road to come.\nCourse Outline: Week 1: Working it Out: The Philosophy of Work Week 2: Labour, Work, and Action: Hannah Arendt on the vita activa. Week 3: The Dignity of Work: Is Work our Salvation? Week 4: The Drudgery of Work: Why Work is Bad for Us Week 5: The Opposite of Work Part I—In Praise of Idleness Week 6: The Opposite of Work Part II—What is Play? Week 7: Our Automated Future: The Future of Work Questions Have you ever had a job that involved substantial external goods (e.g., putting food on the table), but very few internal goods (e.g., satisfaction, fun, enjoyment, a sense of personal development)? What about the reverse situation? And now a follow-up: how do you balance external and internal goods in your own approach to work? A very general question this, but one that is fun to think about: is hierarchy inherently bad? Or even if it is overall a good thing, does it always entail some degree of badness? Few would speak in favour of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s defence of slavery today. But to what degree do you think we are still like Aristotle? In other words, to what degree does our comfort (to the extent that we are comfortable) rest upon the discomfort of others? Is work inherently unjust? Or is there a way that we can make our approach to work much more just? Notes Lars Svendsen, Work (Routledge 2016), p. 10 Genesis 3. Here in the King James version.

            "content": "Life Democritus was born in the city of Abdera in Thrace sometime around 460 BCE. Later accounts say he studied with the philosopher Leucippus. Leucippus is said to have authored two books: On Mind and The Great World System, neither of which has survived. Democritus was much more prolific and is said to have authored up to seventy works.\nBetween them, Leucippus and Democritus introduced a new idea into the Greek philosophical world: the idea that the things of the universe were constructed out of innumerable, infinitesimally small building blocks that they called atoms.\nA perpetual stranger Democritus\u0026rsquo;s teacher was so obscure that even in the ancient world there was debate about his historicity: the philosopher Epicurus even argued (not entirely plausibly) that Leucippus never existed. But with Democritus, we are on more solid ground, even if our knowledge of his life remains hazy. Traditional accounts say that he was the son of a wealthy family and that he blew a large part of his fortune on travels throughout the ancient world. It is said that he was a footloose thinker — spending five years in Egypt, and travelling to Mesopotamia and even as far as India. And in each of these places, he studied with local scholars and philosophers. Democritus apparently also spent some time in Athens (“I came to Athens,” he said, “and no one knew me”), and he had at least a fleeting acquaintance with Socrates.\nThe philosopher of everything Democritus was not only a prolific author; he also wrote on a bewildering variety of topics: from travel accounts to books on medicine, to works on the art of painting, to accounts of Babylonian systems of thought, to works about ethics and philosophy, to books about the shadowy underworld of Hades. Unfortunately, of all these works, only a few fragments remain.\nOther than his omnivorous thirst for knowledge and understanding, the other thing that early accounts say about Democritus is that he was famed for his cheerfulness: he was known as the “laughing philosopher” (in contrast with Heraclitus, who was known as the “weeping philosopher”). And this cheerfulness seems to have served him well. Democritus is said to have died at an advanced age, somewhere between ninety and one hundred years old.\nPhilosophy Atoms and void Democritus and Leucippus are best known for proposing that the bewildering diversity of things in the universe is underpinned by a much simpler reality: the play of atoms in empty space. Democritus proposes an infinite void filled with atoms of various shapes and sizes, so small that they escape our senses. The Greek word atom means “that which cannot be cut.” For Democritus, an atom is the smallest possible unit upon which things can be built. Atoms are eternal and indestructible, and everything that exists emerges out of a restless soup of atoms in motion through the void.\nThese atoms cannot be directly perceived, but when they come together in agglomerations, they make up the things that we can perceive with our senses_._ You can imagine the atoms as being like little burrs and seeds, with hooks and rough parts that allow them to join together, without losing their distinctness. When the hooks that link atom to atom become undone, then things fall apart: whether these things are cups, Greek vases, or human bodies.\nIn his work On Democritus, Aristotle summarised the atomist philosopher\u0026rsquo;s view as follows:\nDemocritus holds that the substances are so small that they escape our senses. They have all kinds of forms and shapes and differences in size. Out of these as elements, he generates and forms visible and perceptible bodies. [These substances] are at odds with one another and move in the void because of their dissimilarity and the other differences I have mentioned, and as they move they strike against one another and become entangled in a way that makes them be in contact and close to one another but does not make any thing out of them that is truly one, for it is quite foolish [to think] that two or more things could ever come to be one.A Presocratics Reader, p. 112\nOften it\u0026rsquo;s said that Democritus\u0026rsquo;s physics involves only two elements: atoms and void. But Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account makes clear that one other thing is essential for his system to work: the restless movement of atoms.\nThis is one reason Aristotle disapproves of Democritus. For Aristotle, nothing moves unless pushed. But Democritus makes movement one of the primary aspects of the universe. Aristotle complains that the early atomists don\u0026rsquo;t give an adequate account of why and how things move.\nFor they say that there is always motion. But why it is and what motion it is, they do not state, nor do they give the cause of its being of one sort rather than another.From Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Metaphysics, in A Presocratics Reader, p. 112\nBut perhaps for the atomists, the question isn\u0026rsquo;t so much why and how things move, but instead, it is why and how it is they stay put, at least for a short while. In a restless universe, what needs to be accounted for is how things remain semi-stable, rather than how they move at all.\nLaughter, mockery and good cheer The idea that everything is at root made up of blindly clashing atoms may seem a bleak one. But Democritus was, after all, the laughing philosopher. So what was there to laugh about?\nSome later commentators claimed that Democritus\u0026rsquo;s laughter was a mocking laughter at the follies of human existence. But there may be another reason for Democritus\u0026rsquo;s laughter. Although the remaining fragments show us that Democritus was capable of sharpness in the face of what he perceived as human folly, they don\u0026rsquo;t give the sense of him as a philosopher concerned with mockery or disdain. So perhaps there was a sunnier side to Democritus\u0026rsquo;s laughter. And this sunnier side may lie in his view of ethics.\nFor Democritus, the root of ethics is a concern with euthymia, which means “possessing a happy spirit,” or “being cheerful.” In fact, Democritus was so preoccupied with this idea of cheerfulness that he wrote a book—now lost—called On Cheerfulness.\nThe goal of life is cheerfulness (euthymia), which is not the same as pleasure . . . but the state in which the soul continues calmly and stably, disturbed by no fear or superstition or any other emotionFrom A Presocratics Reader, p. 124\nThis is a powerful idea: if we understand the world as the result of the play material forces, Democritus suggests, we can be freed from superstition and from other disturbing emotions. It is an idea that the later philosopher Epicurus picks up on and develops, as we will see in a future philosopher file.\nFurther Reading Books The quotes above come from A Presocratics reader: selected fragments and testimonia, edited by Patricia Curd (Hackett 2011). It is one of the best single-volume translations of the work of the Presocratic philosophers.\nFor a more intensely scholarly approach, try The Atomists: Leucippus and Democritus fragments, A Text and Translation with a Commentary by C.C.W.

            "title": "Yang Zhu on How to Keep Our Nature Intact",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Yang Zhu, also known as Yangzi or “Master Yang”, was a Chinese philosopher who lived sometime around the fourth or fifth century BCE, during the Warring States Period in China. We know very little about Yang Zhu himself, and what we know of his philosophy is based on the accounts of other, later writers.\nYang Zhu has always been a controversial philosopher, in part because of his robust emphasis on the importance of care for oneself. He has been criticised for being a monster of self-interest, whose philosophy inevitably leads to the destruction of society. But is this criticism justified?\nPhilosophy The monstrous Mr Yang The fact that we rely on later writers for our knowledge of Yang presents us with a problem. The philosophical tradition has not been kind to Yang Zhu.\nThe earliest reference to Yang\u0026rsquo;s work comes from the Confucian philosopher Mencius (327 – 289 BCE). By this time, if Mencius is to be believed, Yang\u0026rsquo;s philosophy had developed a considerable following. But Mencius says the spread of Yang Zhu\u0026rsquo;s arguments (and the arguments of the philosopher Mozi) put not just individuals, but the whole of society in danger. He presents Yang\u0026rsquo;s thought as a slippery slope that can only lead, inevitably, to cannibalism—although it is not clear whether this cannibalism is real or metaphorical.\nIf the Ways of Yang Zhu and Mozi do not cease, and the Way of Kongzi (Confucius) is not made evident, then evil doctrines will dupe the people and obstruct benevolence and righteousness. If benevolence and righteousness are obstructed, that leads animals to devour people, and then people will begin to devour one another.Mengzi (3B 9.9)\nWhy this disapproval? The core of Mencius\u0026rsquo;s objection to Yang Zhu lies in the earlier philosopher\u0026rsquo;s egoism. Yang is associated with the idea of “being for oneself” (wei wo). Mencius says the following.\nMengzi said, “Yang Zhu favored being ‘for oneself.’ If plucking out one hair from his body would have benefited the whole world, he would not do it.”Mengzi (7A 26.1)\nBut for all Mencius\u0026rsquo;s disapproval, other texts that give a more nuanced, less harshly critical view of Yang.\nKeeping our nature intact It seems that Yang was one of the first Chinese philosophers to be explicitly preoccupied with the question of human nature, or ren xing. The Huainanzi, written in the second century BCE, suggests that Yang\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is about preserving and keeping intact our xing.\nKeeping your nature [xing] intact, protect your authenticity,not burdening your form with things:Yangzi proposed these things, but Mencius opposed them\u0026hellip;Huainanzi (13.9)\nThe Chinese written character for xing can be broken down into two parts: a component that means “heart” or “mind”, and a component that means “growing plant.” So human nature, or ren xing, refers to the dynamic unfolding of a human life. Thus, if the Huainanzi is right, at the heart of Yang Zhu\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is a recognition of the importance of life and wholeness, and the centrality of bodily integrity and well-being to a good life.\nThe goodness of pleasure This doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like the kind of outright hedonism of which Yang Zhu is often accused. And the fourth century BCE Daoist classic called the Liezi also supports a more nuanced reading of what Yang was up to, presenting him in a much more friendly light.\nIn the Liezi, __ Yang Zhu is seen arguing that the extent of human life is at most one hundred years, much of which is lost in infancy, sleep, and senility. The question, then, is how to make the most of what is left to us.\nYang Zhu recognises the centrality of bodily pleasure to a good life. By nature, we seek pleasures of the body: food, fine clothing, sex, music. But we are not only driven by bodily desires. We are also motivated by socially sanctioned systems of rewards and punishments. We seek fame and success, and we compete for status and reputation.\nIn the Liezi, Yang Zhu questions this hunger for success and status. But his objections are not so much moral as they are strategic. For Yang, when it comes down to it, these things are counterproductive. They don\u0026rsquo;t deliver, but instead they imprison and shackle us, and they put us in the way of danger.\nConformity and escape So what should we do instead? Yang Zhu\u0026rsquo;s answer is clear. We should follow the movement of our hearts. We should avoid violating our nature. We should be untroubled by worries about fame and status, and attend to the pleasures of the body. And we should make our way through the world in accord with our nature, not resisting the good things of life, not worrying about posthumous fame, and not worrying about punishment and reward.\nIn the Liezi, Yang Zhu makes a distinction between two different kinds of people. On the one side are the dunren the “escapists” who attempt to wriggle free of human nature by seeking long life, fame, or status and possessions. For Yang, the escapist position is a tragic one because there is no escape. This desire for long life, fame, status, and possessions leads us into danger and leads us to neglect the well-being of the body. It is, Yang says, a maggot that eats away at our vitality.\nSo Yang Zhu proposes a different path: the path followed by the shunmin or “the people in conformity with their nature.” The shunmin are those who follow their xing. They attend to their bodily needs and treat any success or reputation like a fleeting guest.\nIn this reading, Yang isn\u0026rsquo;t proposing rampant egoism, as Mencius believed. He is suggesting something more intimate: attending to the tenderness, the softness, and the pleasures of bodily existence, avoiding the snares of status, rank and possessions, so that we have the best possible chance of flourishing.\nFurther Reading Books Quotes from Mencius come from Bryan Van Norden\u0026rsquo;s translation, Mengzi: with selections from traditional commentaries (Hackett 2008).\nFor the Huainanzi, I used The Huainanzi: a guide to the theory and practice of government in early Han China translated by John S. Major (Columbia University Press 2010). My translation above is modified from Major\u0026rsquo;s.\nThere are a couple of translations of the Liezi available.

Graham\u0026rsquo;s The Book of Lieh-tzu: A Classic of Dao (Columbia University Press 1990) is a little more scholarly, and arguably more accurate.\nYou can find all these texts online at the brilliant ctext.org.\nOnline Resources Read this interesting chapter by Kim-Chong Chong on egoism in Chinese ethics.\nImage: Joyous Celebration at the New Year by Yao Wen-han (1713-?), Qing dynasty.

And we\u0026rsquo;re going to ask about whether there is a deeper connection between wisdom and love.\nThe first person to talk about philosophy as the love of wisdom was the Greek philosopher Pythagoras. The idea that philosophy is the love of wisdom—rather than, for example, the practice of wisdom—puts a bit of a distance between us and the wisdom that we aspire to. We can love wisdom without being entirely wise, just as we can love virtue without being entirely virtuous, or we can love beauty without being entirely beautiful.\nBut the idea of philosophy as the love of wisdom is also a dynamic one. We are impelled towards that thing that we love. It draws us in, fascinates us, intrigues us. And we want more of it in our lives.\nWisdom\u0026rsquo;s love There are two ways of thinking about what it means to talk about the love of wisdom. First, we can see wisdom as an object of love. There are lots of things that we might love: a person, a cat, samosas, mimosas… These things may be more or less worthy of love, but they are all objects towards which our love and our interest are directed. If we understand the love of wisdom like this, then wisdom is simply the object of our fascination, or even our infatuation.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s another way of thinking about the love of wisdom. Because this phrase could also mean something like “the love possessed by wisdom,” or even “wisdom\u0026rsquo;s love” (in the same way that “the cat of my neighbour” can mean “the cat possessed by my neighbour”, or “my neighbour\u0026rsquo;s cat.”)\nIf we understand the love of wisdom in the first sense, with wisdom simply as the object of love, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t commit us to any particular understanding of wisdom. But if we understand it in the second sense, then this suggests that there is something about wisdom that entails love. So if we understand the phrase “the love of wisdom” as equivalent to “wisdom\u0026rsquo;s love”, a deeper relationship between love and wisdom emerges. And we can start to see that maybe philosophy is not just about how we think about the world, but it is also about the quality we bring to this thinking: a quality of attention, care, or love.\nLove\u0026rsquo;s wisdom Even if we agree that philosophy has something to do with love and something to do with wisdom, we might tend to give the idea of wisdom a higher value than love. In this view, love is the means to wisdom, and wisdom as the goal.\nBut two thinkers in the 20th century reversed the order of these two terms, asking what it would mean to think about philosophy instead as the “wisdom of love,” or as “love\u0026rsquo;s wisdom.”\nThe first of these philosophers was Emmanuel Levinas, who was preoccupied throughout his life by the ethics of our interpersonal relationships. In his monumentally difficult book Otherwise than Being, Levinas wrote that philosophy was “the wisdom of love at the service of love.” [1]\nThis claim appears at the end of a particularly knotty passage of philosophy. And it would take us too far off course to plunge into these complexities. But very briefly, what Levinas is suggesting is that the primary impulse towards philosophy—the thing that makes us seek reasons and justifications at all—is our ethical responsibility to others, or love.\nThe other philosopher who makes the same move is Michel Serres, in his little pamphlet En amour, sommes-nous des bêtes (or In Love, Are We Beasts?). Here, Serres makes an argument from etymology. He says that when we translate the Greek word philosophia, we tend to reverse the two terms, getting them back to front.\nThe sages define philosophy as the love of wisdom. It must be the case that these learned people are ignorant of language. In most of our composite words, we would do better to read the roots back to front: automobile, that which move itself; geology, science of the earth; tightrope-walker, one who walks on a tightrope… In truth philosophy would then be the wisdom of love. [2]\nSerres\u0026rsquo;s claims about etymology may or may not be correct. But both Serres and Levinas raise interesting questions about how we think about what philosophy is, and what it should aim at. Does being a philosopher mean being somebody committed to wisdom (sagesse, in French) or to becoming sage-like, and thinking better? Or does it mean being somebody who is committed to love (amour), or to loving better? When aiming to become philosophers, are we attempting to become sages or lovers? Or are we to attempting to be both: lovable sages and sagacious lovers?\nA tangle of wisdom and love One suggestion from Ancient Greek philosophy is that perhaps we are aiming at both. In a previous article, we looked at Diotima\u0026rsquo;s ladder, and the idea of the love as a process of transcendence. In the same passage in the Symposium, Socrates talks about how the philosopher and priestess Diotima taught him that philosophy is a pursuit in which both wisdom and love are tangled up together.\nFor Diotima, love is interesting because it represents an ambiguous, in-between state. Socrates retells a dialogue with Diotima where he suggests to his teacher that love is a “great god.” But Diotima disagrees. Perplexed, Socrates proposes instead that perhaps love is a mortal being. Again, Diotima says that this is not the case. Instead, she says, love is a “great spirit” that is “between god and mortal” [3].\nThis is a strange claim, one steeped in mythology. But it is important for how Socrates understands philosophy. Because the love of wisdom also occupies this in-between space, where we are no longer fully in the world of ignorance, but nor are we fully wise. This is the passage from the text.\n“In that case, Diotima, who are the people who love wisdom, if they are neither wise nor ignorant?” “That’s obvious,” she said. “A child could tell you. Those who love wisdom fall in between those two extremes. And Love is one of them, because he is in love with what is beautiful, and wisdom is extremely beautiful. It follows that Love must be a lover of wisdom and, as such, is in between being wise and being ignorant.\nYou could see love as a bridge to wisdom (recalling the bridge of trust in the previous article), one that hovers ambiguously between the states of ignorance and wisdom, without belonging fully to either. For Socrates—and Diotima too—without love to bridge the gap, there is no way that we could challenge our ignorance, and continue our pursuit of wisdom.\nAttentiveness: the double paths of love and wisdom But love and wisdom are not just complementary. They also exist to some extent in tension with each other. They represent two different paths.\nThere is a long tradition that says the pursuit of wisdom begins in wonder: in a delighted fascination with the world. At the beginning of his Metaphysics, Aristotle writes that:\nBy nature, all men long to know. An indication is their delight in the senses. For these, quite apart from their utility, are intrinsically delightful, and that through the eyes more than the others. [5]\nThe Five Senses of Summer by Sebastian Stoskopff 1633. Musée de l’ OEuvre Notre-Dame, Strasbourg. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nPhilosophy starts with the fact that we like new sensations, and we like the new knowledge these sensations bring. In particular, we like to look at the world, to drink it in with our eyes. This business of delighted, pleasurable looking at the world, Aristotle maintains, is what kick-starts us in the pursuit of wisdom.\nBut for this sensory delight to be translated into wisdom, for Aristotle we need to be able to see through the multiplicity of the world to the subtle web of underlying principles and causes that binds everything together.\nThe ideal philosopher, in Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view, has a keen eye on two things. First, they are fascinated by the diversity and multiplicity of the world (you could call this love). And second, they are intrigued by the principles that underlie this diversity and multiplicity (you could call this wisdom).\nThis is why Aristotle himself was interested in pretty much everything, from the nature of the soul to the mating habits of octopuses, from the lives of bees to the most fundamental questions about the nature of space, time, and causation.\nThe Task of Philosophy: Practices of Love and Wisdom One way you could see Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s double-focus is as two different paths of attention. The first path foregrounds wisdom, and seeks out general principles. The other path foregrounds love, and looks for everything that is singular and unique.\nThis is how the Italian novelist Italo Calvino puts it in his Six Memos for the Next Millennium:\nOne path, goes into the mental space of bodiless rationality, where one may trace lines that converge, projections, abstract forms, vectors of force. The other path goes through a space crammed with objects and attempts to create a verbal equivalent of that space by filling the page with words, involving a most careful, painstaking effort to adapt what is written to what is not written, to the sum of what is sayable and not sayable. [6]\nPerhaps, then, wisdom and love exist in some kind of tension. Wisdom seeks out general principles. Love seeks out uniqueness and singularity. And philosophy sits somewhere in the middle of these things as a practice of deepening both love and wisdom. Then, as we progress on the philosophical path, not only do we understand and appreciate ever more deeply both the general patterns that underlie things, but we are more awakened to the sheer richness and diversity of the world.\nLove and wisdom exist in tension, but they also sustain each other. If we only see uniqueness, individuals and singularities, we miss the fabric that knits together the world. But if we only see general principles and patterns, we miss what makes any one thing so singular and unique. And besides, as Diotima knew, it is in the spaces in between—in the tensions, the gaps, the complicated middle places—that the interesting stuff happens.\nMarco Polo\u0026rsquo;s caravan by Abraham Cresques in the Atlas Catalan 1375. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nTo finish, then, I want to retell a story about these two paths. In his book Invisible Cities, Italo Calvino tells a parable about Kublai Khan, the ruler of China, and the Italian adventurer Marco Polo.\nThe two men are playing chess. For the Khan, the chessboard is an abstract representation of his empire. He has reduced the diversity and complexity of the world down to the abstract principles of the chessboard. His moves on the chessboard echo his decisions as emperor. The game of ruling an empire is a vast chess game, a matter of strategy and general principles. But the Khan has been emperor so long, and has won so many victories, he is no longer clear what his empire consists of. Calvino writes,\nAt checkmate, beneath the foot of the king, knocked aside by the winner\u0026rsquo;s hand, nothingness remains. By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire\u0026rsquo;s multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes; it was reduced to a square of planed wood. [7]\nYou could see the Khan as the representation of somebody who has pushed the path of wisdom to its limit. He has declared checkmate, but is no longer sure what he has won. He has only general principles, but he has lost the uniqueness of the world.\nSo then Marco Polo leans over the chessboard, and tells the Khan what he sees.\nThen Marco Polo spoke: \u0026ldquo;Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of trunk that grew in year of drought: you see how its fibers are arranged? Here barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night\u0026rsquo;s frost forced it to desist\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; [8]\nMarco goes on talking, moving backwards from general principles to specifics, and suddenly the empire comes flooding back in, and the Khan once again understands what it means not just to rule the empire, but perhaps also to love it. Calvino ends the passage like this:\nThe quantity of things that could he read in a little piece of smooth and empty wood overwhelmed Kublai; Polo was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows\u0026hellip;[9]\nCalvino\u0026rsquo;s vision of life is one where wisdom and love support each other, even while they exist in tension with each other. If there is always this tension between love and wisdom, we can perhaps never find true wisdom (and perhaps we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t aim to). Likewise, we may never find true love. But in the back-and-forth between the two, we can find deeper ways of appreciating and understanding the world: both the general patterns that underlie all things, and the uniqueness of every single thing and every single situation.\nQuestions Here are some questions to get you thinking about this week\u0026rsquo;s article. If you are a member, dive into the comments on the Agora, and let\u0026rsquo;s chat.\nThe claim I am making here is that love is about understanding specifics and what makes something unique, and wisdom is about understanding general principles. But is this true? If you think of philosophy as the “wisdom of love”, how does this change your idea of what philosophy is, and what it should do? Is true wisdom possible? And what about true love? Does one exclude the other? In what sense is love something that exists “in between” (you might want to have a look at the Philosopher File on Diotima here). We often think that tension between different approaches to life is something to be eradicated or overcome. In this piece, I\u0026rsquo;m suggesting that these tensions can be creative, even if you can\u0026rsquo;t overcome them. Is this really the case? Finally, looking back on the whole course, how—if at all—has your understanding of love shifted since you started the course?

            "content": "Life All contemporary traditions of Buddhism trace their origins to a wandering sage-philosopher from India, sometimes called Siddhārtha Gautama, or simply known as “the Buddha.” The Buddha\u0026rsquo;s dates are not well-established: estimates range from between the sixth century BCE to the latter half of the 5th century BCE or even the early part of the 4th century BCE. And despite the vastness of the Buddhist textual tradition, the details of the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s life are still controversial.\nBy the fifth century BCE, and possibly much before, there was a flourishing tradition in India of so-called “renouncers” or śramaṇas. These renouncers were a motley collection of wandering philosophers, religious practitioners and truth-seekers (we\u0026rsquo;ve already seen how similar figures existed in Greece). In Indian society, religious authority lay with the Brahmin priestly class. But these wanderers rejected Brahminical authority in pursuit of a range of different religious and philosophical visions.\nLater accounts depict the Buddha as a member of this rag-tag society of wandering philosophers, wandering through Northern India meditating, teaching, debating, and gathering around himself an increasingly large number of disciples.\nThe Disappearing Buddha Despite the copiousness of the later Buddhist textual tradition, there are no written accounts of the Buddha until around the 3rd century BCE. This distance in time from the purported dates of the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s life has caused some recent researchers to call into question the Buddha\u0026rsquo;s historicity. The historian David Drewes has recently gone so far as to argue (not uncontroversially) that there\u0026rsquo;s no compelling evidence for the existence of the Buddha, and that even if the Buddha did exist, we don\u0026rsquo;t really know who he was. For Drewes, the Buddha has the same status as mythical figures such as, “Agamemnon, Homer, or King Arthur; Vyāsa, Vālmīki, Kṛṣṇa, or Rāma.” This mythical status testifies to the cultural significance of these figures within a body of stories; but, Drewes argues, it “does not make it possible to identify [these stories] as historical.”\nBut, putting questions about the exact nature of the historicity of the Buddha to one side, there are two legacies of the Buddhist tradition that continue to exert their pull over people down to the present. The first is the legendary life of the Buddha (after all, even mythical beings have a real effect in the world). And the second is the body of distinctive Buddhist teachings that started to be recorded around the 3rd century BCE.\nThe Great Renunciant? The legendary tale of Gautama Buddha is as compelling as it is implausible. In this story, Gautama was a prince sequestered in a palace, entirely shielded from the miseries and sufferings of the world. But one day, he went out and encountered in turn an old person, a sick person, a corpse, and a wandering renunciant, or śramaṇa.\nThese things came to him as an existential shock. He had never known about sickness, death and old age until this day. And now he realised that however luxurious his life in the palace, it offered him no refuge from suffering. But he saw in the peaceful demeanour of the śramaṇa the clue to a different way of living. So he sneaked out of the palace at night (in many accounts, his departure assisted by a flock of friendly gods), chopped off his hair, put on the robes of a śramaṇa, and committed himself to overcoming the world\u0026rsquo;s many disappointments.\nEventually, it is said, he broke through to attain a state of awakening, or enlightenment. And then, for the rest of his life, he taught his followers how to emulate this same experience.\nPhilosophy Dukkha and rebirth In Buddhism, these disappointments are referred to by the term dukkha. This is sometimes translated as “suffering”, but it has a much wider range of reference. Dukkha is the way that our experience always harbours some element of dissatisfaction. Dukkha may refer to the terrible pain of a toothache; but equally it may refer to that shadow that seems to accompany even many of our most cherished experiences. So when we win the Nobel Prize, although the Norwegians are friendly and our career is at its peak, it feels a bit hollow. Or when we smile at the crowd on our wedding day, and say “It\u0026rsquo;s the happiest day of my life,” there\u0026rsquo;s still a thread of melancholy we can\u0026rsquo;t shake. This isn\u0026rsquo;t a claim that the world is inherently miserable. It is a more subtle claim: the claim that all of our experience is marked by a kind of lack or disappointment.\nIn the Indian tradition, these disappointments were compounded by the fact that it was assumed they would effectively go on forever. As with many early Indian traditions, the idea of rebirth lies at the heart of Buddhist philosophy. And although this idea might seem comforting to many contemporary readers, for the early Buddhists, it was nothing less than horror. It meant that the sufferings of existence were an unending, constant cycle. And the most crucial question was how this horror show could be brought to an end, and how we could step off this perpetual wheel.\nIn the traditional story, after departing the palace, the future Buddha trained in meditation and practised self-starvation. But he eventually realised that this was fruitless as a path to liberation. So he turned his back on austerity and regained his strength by eating a meal. Then he sat down under a fig tree somewhere on the plains of Northern India, and he resolved not to move until he had solved the problem of rebirth. And eventually, he had an insight so profound that it broke the chains that bound him to the sufferings of the world. After this shattering insight, he dedicated his life to teaching others the path to the freedom from dukkha.\nWhile as a historical figure, the Buddha seems frustratingly slippery, the early Buddhist texts nevertheless set out a distinctive philosophical vision. Ideas about dukkha and rebirth lie at the heart of this vision. But early Buddhists also developed profound insights into the nature of human experience. And they did this through the practice of meditation.\nMeditation as transformation and meditation as analysis The early Buddhist texts in the Pāli language repeatedly pick away at the problem of dukkha. What is this niggling disappointment that seems written into the heart of experience? What is its source? What is its ending? And how can we bring about its ending?\nBut these are not theoretical questions so much as questions to be explored directly through the practice of meditation. A good example of how this worked is in the Mahāsaccaka Sutta, where the Buddha talks about his practice of meditation.\n“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’;…‘This is the origin of suffering’;…‘This is the cessation of suffering’;…‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’;…‘These are the taints’;…‘This is the origin of the taints’;…‘This is the cessation of the taints’;…‘This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.’\nMeditative practices go far back into Indian history, and precede the coming of Buddhism. By the time of early Buddhism, it was well-established that many of these meditative practices could lead to altered states of consciousness, called jhānas—states that potentially were (and still are) profoundly transformative. These states are described in detail in the early Buddhist texts, a series of successively more subtle stages that lead up to the state of Nirodha-samāpatti, or the “cessation of perception and feeling.”\nContemporary meditators also attest to such states where sense experience fades away, but awareness nevertheless persists. And with the fading of sense experience, they attest to how the dissatisfaction that is a part of sense experience also fades.\nFrom cosmic speculation to experience But there is another aspect to meditation as well. Because the early Buddhists dedicated themselves not only to the cultivation of certain kinds of experience (or non-experience), but also to the interrogation of the nature of experience itself. This is the great innovation of early Buddhist thought: it uses meditative practices as a way of turning our attention to the question of what experience is, and how it is constituted.\nThis marks a significant change in the philosophical traditions of India. Earlier Indian philosophers had speculated about how reality was constituted. In the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, Gārgī Vācaknavī asks the intriguing question, “on what is the world (loka) woven back and forth?” And before this, in the Rig Veda, we meet the following riot of questions:\nWho really knows? Who will here proclaim it? Whence was it [the world] produced? Whence is this creation? The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe. Who then knows whence it has arisen?Whence this creation has arisen – perhaps it formed itself, or perhaps it did not – the one who looks down on it, in the highest heaven, only he knows – or perhaps he does not know.\nThe scholar Sue Hamilton refers to these kinds of questions as “cosmic speculation.” And the early Buddhist texts are not entirely without cosmic speculation. But the tenor of the texts as a whole is strikingly different from this.\nLike the Upaniṣads, the Buddhist texts talk about the loka or the world. But in the Buddhist texts, loka does not refer to the external world, and the Buddhists are not talking about ontology. Instead, as Hamilton argues, they are talking about the world of experience, about how we understand and perceive the world. The “world” that the early Buddhists cared about was the world of subjective experience. It was in this world that dukkha or disappointment could be found, and in this world that its cessation could be found also.\nThrough the practice of meditation, in other words, the early Buddhists argued it was possible to attain to an insight into the dynamics of experience. And when we do this, we are no longer entrapped by the disappointment that is threaded through our experience of the world, and we can liberate ourselves.\nFurther Reading Books and articles Sue Hamilton, Identity and Experience: the Constitution of the Human Being According to Early Buddhism (Luzac Oriental 1996).\nThe Mahāsaccaka Sutta can be found in The Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha: a new translation of the Majjhima Nikāya, translated by Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoli (Wisdom Publications 1995).\nThe Rig Veda is translated by Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty (Penguin 1981).\nOnline Resources David Drewes\u0026rsquo;s article \u0026rsquo;The Idea of the Historical Buddha\u0026rsquo; is published in the Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies vol_._ 40 (2017), pp. 1-25.

            "content": "Introduction Imagine you\u0026rsquo;ve been dating somebody for a while. Things are going well. You like each other, and the dates are all enjoyable and fun. You are pretty happy with how things are progressing. But one day, the other person turns to you—an intense look on their face—and says in a tremulous voice, “I love you.”\nYou are stunned. Astonished. This puts things on a different footing. Everything has moved up a notch, and you are not sure how to respond. Perhaps your reaction to this revelation of love is pleasure and delight. Perhaps you are horrified, and you descend into wild panic, making your excuses and resolving to cut all contact. Either way, this declaration of love has changed things. There\u0026rsquo;s no way back from saying “I love you.”\nBut this is also pretty strange. What has just happened? Why has this declaration—these “three little words” as the popular songs have it—had such a transformative impact? One answer is given by the philosopher Alain Badiou, who writes that:\nA declaration of the \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo; kind seals the act of the encounter, is central and constitutes a commitment. [1]\nFor Badiou, love always begins in contingency, in chance encounters. But with the declaration of love, something changes. Saying \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo;, Badiou writes, is a way of \u0026ldquo;locking in chance\u0026rdquo; [2]. Until now, this love affair has been another uncertain, changeable thing in a world governed by chance. But now this declaration has been made, something new has entered into the equation. What was once under the spell of chance now becomes an opportunity of constructing something new: a new truth or a new future. Again, Badiou writes that\nBut chance, at a given moment, must be curbed. It must turn into a process that can last. This is a very difficult, almost metaphysical problem: how can what is pure chance at the outset become the fulcrum for a construction of truth? [3]\nNo wonder it\u0026rsquo;s such a big deal when somebody says, \u0026ldquo;I love you.\u0026rdquo; Because perhaps this simple statement is, as Badiou concludes, \u0026ldquo;a declaration of eternity to be fulfilled or unfurled as best it can be within time: eternity descending into time.\u0026rdquo; [4]\nImage: Woman with love letter, by Ikeda Terukata, 1910. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nLove, trust and the future When we declare love like this, we are saying something about the future. We are saying how we want the future to be. We are saying that we will value this connection regardless of the comings and going of change and chance. We are saying that this love will subsist come what may. Because, as Shakespeare puts it in Sonnet 116, \u0026ldquo;Love is not love / Which alters when it alteration finds…\u0026rdquo;\nThis connection with the future also necessarily involves trust. We don\u0026rsquo;t know that things will work out. But we put our trust in this person or in this relationship nevertheless.\nIt is trust that bridges the gap when the future is uncertain. As the philosopher Onora O\u0026rsquo;Neill puts it, trust is called for, \u0026ldquo;not because everything is wholly predictable, let alone wholly guaranteed, but on the contrary because life has to be led without guarantees.\u0026quot;[5] Trust matters most when there is a deficit of knowledge, when we have to make judgements in the face of incomplete evidence. Putting our faith in another person, we stake our life on the chance that things will work out. And we hope our trust will be warranted. We don’t trust the other person because we know things will go well, but out of the hope that they will do so, and that our trust in this other human being will be rewarded.\nThe word \u0026ldquo;trust\u0026rdquo; itself has its roots in the Old Norse term treysta. The Old Norse term means \u0026ldquo;to secure\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;to rely on\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;to make safe and strong.\u0026rdquo; When we extend trust to others, our world becomes more solid, more concrete, more reliable. In trusting, as the Dutch philosopher Adriaan Peperzak puts it, \u0026ldquo;I join or bind myself to another person and this person to me…\u0026quot;[8] Trust happens in the extending of trust—step-by-step, incrementally. And if things work out well, which is never guaranteed, it makes the world safer, stronger and more secure. This makes trust something like one of those bridges you find in folktales, and that only appear when you take the first step. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example, from Ben Okri\u0026rsquo;s Booker prize-winning novel, Astonishing the Gods.\nHe was still wondering about the places beyond, from which understanding comes, when he found himself at the foot of a fabulous bridge. The bridge, completely suspended in the air, held up by nothing that he could see, was a dazzling construct, composed entirely of mist. He was bewildered by the insubstantiality of the bridge. It too seemed to be made of light, of air, of feelings. He was afraid to step on it lest he would plunge down below. \u0026ldquo;What holds up the bridge?\u0026rdquo; he asked his guide. \u0026ldquo;Only the person crossing it,\u0026rdquo; came the reply. \u0026ldquo;You mean that if I am to cross the bridge I must at the same time hold it up, keep it suspended?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;But how can I do both at the same time?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;If you want to cross over you must. There is no other way.\u0026quot;[6]\nThere is no other way. You have to take the first step, without any guarantee that things will work out. Trusting isn\u0026rsquo;t about weighing up risks. If you are weighing up risks, as the Danish Philosopher Søren Kierkegaard knew, you are not trusting. Instead, you are falling into mistrust.\nKierkegaard wrote that love, and the trust that underpins love, \u0026ldquo;builds up\u0026rdquo;—an idea he took from I Corinthians 8:1. But what does love build? It builds itself, in the same way that is the one who crosses the bridge who keeps it suspended. This is why mistrust is so harmful: because is incapable of building anything at all. Mistrust, Kierkegaard wrote, \u0026ldquo;does exactly the opposite of what love does.\u0026quot;[7]\nTrust and trustworthiness But does love demand we trust indiscriminately? Surely this looks like a huge risk. In her brilliant TED talk on trust, O\u0026rsquo;Neill explores the idea that we are living through a crisis in trust. You would think that if there was such a crisis, the solution would be that we should aim to trust more. However, O\u0026rsquo;Neill argues this is not the case at all.\nI think that\u0026rsquo;s a stupid aim. It\u0026rsquo;s not what I would aim at. I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy. In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.[9]\nThere are many occasions when defaulting to trust is clearly unwise. A famous folk-tale from the Anvaar Soheili, a Persian collection of fables dating to around 1500 CE, tells of how a scorpion hitched a ride across the river on the back of its friend, an obliging turtle. The scorpion promised it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t sting the turtle; but when it reached the other side, it did so anyway.\nFortunately, the turtle was unscathed, having the protection of its shell (a later version of the story has a frog, not a turtle, with less happy results). And when the turtle protested that this wasn\u0026rsquo;t any way to treat your friends, the scorpion replied saying, more or less, \u0026ldquo;Well, what do you expect? I\u0026rsquo;m a scorpion. It\u0026rsquo;s kind of what I do.\u0026rdquo;\nThe lights of Canopus, A tortoise carries a scorpion on its back across a river, Walters Art Museum Ms. W.599, fol.40b Public domain via Flickr.\nThere are some people, in other words, whom we might have dealings with, whom we might even like or consider to be friends, but whom we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t trust, at least in certain domains. So building trust by trusting more is not necessarily a wise move. Instead, we should be more judicious when it comes to whom we trust. And because we have no direct power over the trustworthiness of others, we should work on becoming more trustworthy ourselves. Because we are the ones who hold up the bridges we cross.\nTrust, love and building the future The Chinese Confucian tradition has a lot to say about this process of developing trustworthiness. One of the core virtues in Confucianism is xin, which can be translated as \u0026ldquo;trustworthiness\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;reliability.\u0026rdquo; For philosopher Karyn Lai, this reliability has two components.[10] The first component is ethical: it is about consistency of action and behaviour over time. Love is something that builds, and to build you need to aim for consistency, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t always attain it. But the second component of reliability is more to do with epistemology, or how we know and understand the world. To be reliable, you need to have a clear grasp of the fact of changeability, and the ability to respond flexibly to different circumstances so that, even when things are difficult or unpredictable, you can continue to be relied upon.\nThe Chinese character for \u0026ldquo;reliability\u0026rdquo; is 信. This character is made up of two components. The component on the left is ren (亻or 人), and means \u0026ldquo;human being\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;person\u0026rdquo;. Meanwhile, the component on the right is yan (言), and means \u0026ldquo;word\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;something that is spoken.\u0026rdquo; One popular understanding of this term is that it represents somebody who quite literally stands by their word. This perhaps this is why, for Badiou, love declarations are so significant. Because once you say \u0026ldquo;I love you,\u0026rdquo; you have staked yourself on a particular future, and you are answerable for this future and how it turns out.\nTo respond to the demands of reliability, Lai writes, we need to build a repertoire of successful and effective actions. This repertoire will enable us to navigate through uncertainties and changeable circumstances. It is not a fixed and habitual set of actions. Instead, you could think of it as being close to the way a navigator steers a predictable course, whatever the weather throws at them (see the article on wisdom and navigation from the previous season). And of course, life being what it is, things don\u0026rsquo;t always work out so well. There are, inevitably, lapses and mistakes. Lai writes:\nEach action is significant as, together with others and taken over time, it cumulatively adds to a picture of agency. Isolated lapses or failures may not necessarily alter the perception of a person’s ability, just as a celebrated musician’s slip up at one concert may not necessarily affect her reputation as a skilled performer. Nevertheless, if a pattern of mishaps develops over time, our picture of her reliability will change.\nAnd here, perhaps, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to see the force of the idea of reliability. Because genuine reliability can outlast the span of a relationship. If after a while—a week, a month, a year, a lifetime—you end up heading off towards different futures, is this the end of love? Or is it one of love\u0026rsquo;s many alterations? And if, once a relationship ends, you can continue to respond to the other person with love and care and concern, perhaps this is not love\u0026rsquo;s failure, but instead love\u0026rsquo;s confirmation.\nQuestions Let\u0026rsquo;s get stuck into this week\u0026rsquo;s questions. When you\u0026rsquo;ve had a think, dive into the comments on the Agora, and let\u0026rsquo;s chat.\nHave you ever told anyone \u0026ldquo;I love you\u0026rdquo;? If so, what did you mean? According to Shakespeare, \u0026ldquo;Love is not love / Which alters when it alteration finds…\u0026rdquo; But isn\u0026rsquo;t there such a thing as fleeting love? And is this not in some ways as important as more enduring love? In what way do declarations of love help build a future? Is reliability in itself a virtue, even if people are reliably bad? Think of the scorpion, which is reliable in stinging others, or a friend who reliably steals $10 from your wallet. Can we love those who are reliably bad more than those who are sporadically bad? What practices can help us develop reliability? And why should we bother developing it?

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Diogenes — also known as the Dog — was a native of the state of Sinope on the Black Sea coast. He was born around 410 BCE, by which time Sinope was a busy commercial hub, standing at the end of a trade route that stretched all the way to Mesopotamia.\nAccording to early accounts of Diogenes\u0026rsquo;s life, his father Hicesias was in charge of managing the Sinope mint. But there was a scandal about counterfeit, defaced or adulterated coinage, which led to Diogenes fleeing into exile in Athens.\nThe exact details of the scandal differ depending on whose account you read, and it\u0026rsquo;s not clear what went so wrong at the Sinope mint. But the textual records are supported by archaeological evidence of defaced coins bearing the name of Hicesias, giving more weight to the story.\nDiogenes the dog Some accounts say that after fleeing Sinope, Diogenes went to consult the Delphic oracle who told him to keep on defacing the currency. Diogenes understood this as a call to overturn the everyday currency of customs and moral norms that underpinned Greek society.\nWhen he moved to Athens, Diogenes became a student of Antisthenes, the ascetically minded follower of Socrates. And he resolved to live unconventionally. He became homeless by choice, and he took up residence in a large earthenware storage jar in the street. For the following few years, Diogenes lived, ate and even publicly masturbated in his street-dwelling. When the citizens of Athens complained about impropriety, Diogenes apparently retorted, “If only rubbing the stomach could alleviate hunger pains as easily.”\nIt is this behaviour that gained Diogenes the nickname “the Dog” or kynikos.__ Antisthenes had also been known by this insult (or by the even better-sounding “downright dog”). But although these terms were meant as insults, Diogenes took the name to heart. Once, when asked why he was called “the Dog”, Diogenes calmly replied that:\nI fawn on the people who give me something, bark at those who don’t, and sink my teeth into scoundrels.Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes_, p. 43._\nIt is from this nickname that the philosophical tradition started by Diogenes took its name: in Greek, kynikos means “dog-like.” As far as the Cynic followers of Diogenes were concerned, there was much that was admirable and worthy of emulation in the lives of dogs because dogs live naturally, without the encumbrances of culture and conventional morality.\nSea-dogs and pirates At some point, Diogenes the dog became a sea-dog, and he took a voyage to Aegina. It was on this voyage that — if the later accounts are to be believed — he was captured by pirates and sold into slavery. His cockiness on the auction-block attracted the attention of a man from Corinth called Xeniades.\nDiogenes travelled back to Corinth to manage Xeniades\u0026rsquo;s estate, and to tutor his two sons. In Corinth Diogenes is said to have met with Alexander the Great, who famously told Diogenes he would offer the philosopher anything he wanted. Diogenes replied that he wanted Alexander to get out of his way because he was blocking the sunlight.\nAccounts of Diogenes\u0026rsquo;s death differ. According to some stories, he died after being bitten by a dog. Other accounts have him suffocating himself by holding his breath and abstaining from breathing. Still other accounts say he snacked publicly on raw octopus, to demonstrate to an admiring crowd how cooking was a waste of time, and he subsequently died of food poisoning.\nPhilosophy Self-sufficiency and nature The Cynics were the beatniks of the ancient world. They dropped out of the rat-race, preferring to emphasise self-sufficiency or autarkeia. You could recognise a Cynic philosopher by their itinerancy and their fewness of possessions. All you needed if you wanted to be a Cynic was a cloak to keep the weather off you, a backpack to carry a small amount of food or nourishment, and a sturdy staff to help with walking and warding off danger.\nThis itinerant self-sufficiency was backed up by a philosophical critique of the society of which the Cynics were a part. For Diogenes and his later followers, conventional ways of life were profoundly wrong-headed. The pursuit of wealth and status made people hostages to fortune. And the very notion of value was confused and incoherent. Diogenes pointed out that you could get a day\u0026rsquo;s supply of barley-flour — enough to sustain you — for a couple of coppers, but a statue would cost three thousand drachmas. Where, he asked, was the logic in that?\nThis incoherence was why for Diogenes there was an urgent need to remint the moral currency of everyday life. Culture was broken: not just the culture in which Diogenes found himself, but all culture. And true wealth was to be found in turning one\u0026rsquo;s back on culture, embracing self-sufficiency and returning to nature.\nIt is thus necessary that, instead of engaging in useless exertions, we should choose those that are in accordance with nature if we are to live a happy life; but through their foolishness, people are unhappy.From Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes_, p. 46_\nDogs and cosmopolitans One contemporary idea that can be traced back to Diogenes is the idea of cosmopolitanism. In Greek, the word kosmopolitēs means someone whose polis or city-state is the kosmos, or the universe as a whole.\nFor Diogenes, the idea of cosmopolitanism signalled freedom from dependence upon any particular set of cultural or political circumstances. Dogs, after all, feel at home in multiple places. They do not alienate themselves by getting tangled up in political debates, or speculations about the nature of the gods, or an obsession with creating great art, or any of the other peculiar things that human beings do. Instead, they attend to their basic needs, and to what they need to feel at home, wherever they are.\nDiogenes\u0026rsquo;s cosmopolitanism was also a kind of insouciance in the face of good and ill fortune. When we revert to our most basic bodily needs, we find ourselves invulnerable to changes in fortune.\nWhen someone asked him what he had gained from philosophy, he said, \u0026ldquo;This, if nothing else, that I’m prepared for every fortune.\u0026rdquo;From Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes, p. 35\nIf you can cultivate this art of living, Diogenes argues, you can be at home wherever you find yourself: whether you are in Sinope, or driven into exile, or in a jar in the marketplace, or captured by pirates, or gnawing on raw octopus for an admiring crowd in Corinth.\nFurther Reading Books There are several collections of texts about Diogenes. Try, for example, Diogenes the Cynic: Sayings and Anecdotes, With Other Popular Moralists, translated by Robin Hard (Oxford University Press 2012). This is the one I\u0026rsquo;ve used for the translations here. Another good one is the Penguin Classics edition, The Cynic Philosophers: From Diogenes to Julian, translated by Robert Dobbin (Penguin 2012).\nThere are also some good books out there on the Cynics as a philosophical school. William Desmond\u0026rsquo;s Cynics (Acumen 2008) is particularly accessible.\nOnline Resources There\u0026rsquo;s a TED-Ed video from William Desmond on Cynicism.

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "Love, we are told, lifts us up where we belong: “Where the eagles cry / On a mountain high… / Far from the world we know / Where the clear winds blow.”\nWhen we are in love, the world takes on a different, more giddying perspective. But shifts in perspective are tricky things. When we are loved-up and out of our right minds, are we at last seeing the world clearly? Or have we descended into a kind of madness?\nIn this week\u0026rsquo;s article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be exploring love, transcendence, and madness in Plato\u0026rsquo;s dialogues. We\u0026rsquo;re going to see what the priestess and philosopher Diotima has to say about the transcendent path of love in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Symposium. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to see how in the Phaedrus, Socrates argues that love sends us mad—while also making the case that sometimes a spot of madness is just what we need.\nBut we\u0026rsquo;re going to start with the experience of finding ourselves suddenly smitten, caught somewhere between madness and transcendence, just when we least expect it.\nSmitten kittens You don\u0026rsquo;t know how it happens. You can\u0026rsquo;t predict when it will happen. Nevertheless, it happens. One day, you run into somebody new, or you find yourself unexpectedly seeing somebody you already know in a different light. And you are utterly smitten. You are spellbound, enchanted, barely able to breathe or to speak.\nSometimes philosophers refer to this as “limerence”, a term first coined by the psychiatrist Dorothy Tennov in the late 1970s. Tennov invented the word to refer to the strange infatuation with another person that bursts upon you for no obvious reason. In an interview in the UK Observer in 1977, Tennov said,\nI first used the term ‘amorance’ then changed it back to ‘limerence’… It has no roots whatsoever. It looks nice. It works well in French. Take it from me it has no etymology whatsoever.[1]\nIt looks good. It feels right. It works well in French. And it has no roots in the real world. For all these reasons, “limerence” sounds like a well-coined term for romantic infatuation.\nTwo cats stepping out on a date. Painting from Wat Pho temple, Thailand. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nIn her 1979 book Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love, Tennov writes that when you are in a state of limerence, you can think of nothing but the object of your desires. You cannot sleep. You lose your appetite. The object of your desires takes on a transcendent glow. And what you long for most is that your obsession should be reciprocated.\nHowever, there is something problematic with limerence. The single-minded focus of limerent obsession is potentially destructive: both for the one who is so obsessed, and for the object of their obsession. What if the other person has no interest in reciprocation? What if this limerent experience is used to justify (as it often is) all manner of crazy, creepy, stalky, destructive behaviours? Maybe limerence should be seen as a condition, a sickness (and, indeed, there is even a Reddit community dedicated to supporting those “who self-identify as being in the state of limerence and are looking for support and strategies to deal with their condition.”)\nLove\u0026rsquo;s upward trajectory? But, if Plato is to be believed, limerence may also be a doorway to a different way of seeing the world. In the Symposium, Socrates relates the story of how Diotima taught him that infatuation can be the first step on a path to transcendence.\nDiotima\u0026rsquo;s theory of love, as it appears in the Symposium, functions like a staircase or a ladder (it is often referred to as the “ladder of love”). Love is a process of ascent, with each stage providing a broader, more expansive view of love—and of reality itself—than the one before.\nDiotima argues that love begins in an infatuation with the body of a single individual. This infatuation “begets beautiful ideas”—which seems like a nice description of the way our minds can be filled with dreamy notions about the object of our desires.\nBut the path of love only begins here: this is not where it ends. The next stage comes about when the lover realises the same beauty that inspires their infatuation lies not just in their beloved, but in others as well. After all, Diotima cautions, we would “be very foolish not to think that the beauty of all bodies is one and the same.” Here, the lover loosens their obsessive focus on one particular individual, to see that all others are potential objects of love (or of limerence). And when they see this, it becomes apparent that the desire they have for any single individual is a limited, cramped thing. This more general understanding of desire removes the lover from their fixation on a single object. And it reminds them that even though every other individual is unique and singular, this uniqueness and singularity are not in short supply. Singularity is everywhere. Everyone is unique, even if they are not uniquely so.\nThe next stage is when the lover recognises that beauty lies not just in bodies but in souls too. What we are attracted to, in the end, is not just a set of physical attributes, but a person.\nAnd then, taking a further step up the staircase or the ladder, we go from recognising the beauty of persons to perceiving the beauty of the things these persons together fashion: human activities, institutions and cultures. Because if we are in touch with beauty, and if we value beauty, then together we can build beautiful things.\nA philosopher her cat and her dog ascend the staircase of love. Image from 1910, public domain via the Library of Congress.\nAfter this, Diotima says, the lover comes to recognise the beauty of the learning and knowledge that these cultures and institutions sustain. By now, Diotima says, “the lover is turned to the great sea of beauty, and, gazing upon this, they give birth to many gloriously beautiful ideas and theories, in unstinting love of wisdom.”\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s one final stage to this path. The culmination of the path of love is not just in the love of wisdom, or philosophy. Instead, it is in the love of beauty and of love itself. This is how Socrates summarises the argument.\nThis is what it is to go aright, or be led by another, into the mystery of Love: one goes always upwards for the sake of this Beauty, starting out from beautiful things and using them like rising stairs: from one body to two and from two to all beautiful bodies, then from beautiful bodies to beautiful customs, and from customs to learning beautiful things, and from these lessons he arrives in the end at this lesson, which is learning of this very Beauty, so that in the end he comes to know just what it is to be beautiful\u0026hellip;\nSo what starts with our infatuation with one individual other leads us step-wise, Diotima argues, towards true knowledge and towards the love of love. This makes the path of love a complete religious and philosophical path, starting in limerence, and ending in transcendent experience .\nMadly in love? Newspaper advertisement for the American drama film Love Madness (1920) with Louise Glaum, on page 5 of November 26, 1920, The Duluth Herald. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nBut if love takes us above or beyond our right minds, then there\u0026rsquo;s another question we need to ask: is this really such a good thing? After all, Tennov writes that limerence is “clearly a madness.” And Plato and Socrates knew this too. The long sufferings of the Trojan war began with the limerent desires of Paris and Helen. It is no accident that at the opening of Plato\u0026rsquo;s Phaedrus, his dialogue on love and madness, Socrates makes a passing reference to Homer\u0026rsquo;s story.\nBut if love is a kind of madness, in the Phaedrus Socrates wants to make the case that sometimes “the madness of love” is something we should actively seek. Ultimately, Socrates argues, madness can do more for us than “right-minded reason.” And the “divine madness” that is sent by the gods can be humanly and philosophically fruitful. God-sent madness, Socrates says, is better than human self-control.\nSocrates gives four reasons that the madness of love can be beneficial. The first is that there is a connection between madness and prophecy. Socrates uses an etymological argument to talk about the closeness of the word manic or “mad” and the word mantic, or “prophetic” (as in “pyromancy”, meaning divination by fire, or “oneiromancy”, meaning divination by dreams). In the madness of love, we can have more profound insights into the world, just as the oracles of the ancient world, taken by divine madness, spoke prophecies and insights.\nThe second fruit of love\u0026rsquo;s madness, Socrates says, is that it is purificatory. In particular, it has the power to purge us of deep, ancestral guilt. In the wild, purificatory frenzy of madness, we are liberated from the rigorous logic of retribution and responsibility. And we become free.\nThe third fruit of madness is that it gives rise to creativity. We all know, after all, that the love-sick can turn to poetry (often, it has to be said, bad poetry) to try to make sense of their sickness. So the madness of love can provoke us to create new things, in a “frenzy of songs and poetry that glorifies the achievements of the past and teaches them to future generations.”\nAnd the final fruit of madness, Socrates says, is the madness of transcendence. The lover is driven to a transcendent view that put them beyond the world, removed from the everyday logic of the world, soaring towards the realms of pure beauty:\nNow this takes me to the whole point of my discussion of the fourth kind of madness—that which someone shows when he sees the beauty we have down here and is reminded of true beauty; then he takes wing and flutters in his eagerness to rise up, but is unable to do so; and he gazes aloft, like a bird, paying no attention to what is down below\u0026hellip;\nBut in his description of this final kind of madness, Socrates sounds a note of caution. Because for Socrates, love doesn\u0026rsquo;t lift us up where we belong. Or at least, not quite. It provokes the desire for true beauty—the end of Diotima\u0026rsquo;s quest. It sets our eyes on the heavens. It removes us from our concerns with what is “down below.” But as we take wing, our hearts all aflutter in our eagerness to rise beyond the everyday world, we are unable to fully attain the beauty for which we yearn.\nAnd this is perhaps why, when a friend falls hard in love, you find them sitting by the window, staring dreamily out at the sky—as if they\u0026rsquo;ve forgotten the world of which they are still, nevertheless, a part.\nQuestions Here are some questions to get you thinking about this week\u0026rsquo;s lesson. So dive into the comments on the Agora, and let\u0026rsquo;s chat.\nHave you ever experienced limerence? What is this experience like? And what does it tell us about human love and desire? How plausible is Diotima\u0026rsquo;s account of love\u0026rsquo;s upward ascent? The story of Diotima\u0026rsquo;s ladder puts a strong focus on the idea of beauty as something that is powerfully transformative. Do you think that recognising beauty—in others, even in cultures and in institutions—can be transformative in this way? Socrates gives four different arguments in favour of madness. In what ways, if any, can madness (or an absence of reason) be beneficial? In Socrates\u0026rsquo;s account of the madness of love, he doesn\u0026rsquo;t dwell on the potentially destructive effects of this madness (although he does reference the Trojan war in passing). Do you think the destructive effects of “being out of your right mind” with love outweigh the benefits? And if so, what is the best remedy for this madness? Notes [1] The Observer, 11 Sept 1977.

The obligation to understand. The obligation to take this great work seriously. And the obligation to read systematically, one page at a time.\nBut as I suggested in the previous article in this series on reading philosophy at a gallop, this approach can slow you down—to the extent that you end up grinding to a halt. This is why it can be good to pick up the pace and to approach philosophy at speed.\nNevertheless, sometimes even galloping through the book is not enough. And if you are going to get to grips with what you are reading, you have to give up on the idea that philosophy is something you need to read systematically and read haphazardly.\nThe idea that it is okay to read haphazardly takes some getting used to. Partly this is because our instincts in reading are fashioned by reading fiction. In the last piece, I suggested that we could see philosophy as a kind of storytelling: you start off in confusion, and you move through successive stages until you get to the dénouement at the end. In reading fiction, this is part of the pleasure of it. You can of course peek and skip ahead to the last page to see who plunged the knife into the clergyman\u0026rsquo;s heart. And nobody should deprive you of your absolute right to do so if this is what you want to do. But you risk spoiling the fun: they don\u0026rsquo;t call them spoilers for nothing.\nBut if philosophy is a kind of storytelling, it is different from the kind of storytelling you find in fiction. When reading fiction, there\u0026rsquo;s usually enough to keep you entertained while you wait for that dénouement. There are sword fights. There are pirate queens presiding over tiny island republics. There are talking animals. There are moody detectives drinking coffee in the diner at five in the morning. All this compelling stuff is the pay-off that keeps you moving through the world of the story until you find out whodunnit.\nWittgenstein looking Napoleonic. Anonymous photo dated 1891. Public Domain via Wikimedia commons. When reading philosophy books, in contrast, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to worry so much about spoilers (nor, usually, do you need to worry about sword fights, pirate queens, talking animals and moody detectives). There is a kind of fun to be had in reading philosophy—and don\u0026rsquo;t let anyone tell you otherwise. But this is not usually the kind of fun that is spoiled by knowing—philosophically speaking—whodunnit.\nThis means that you are not going to lose out if you start at the end and then move incrementally back to the beginning. Or if you start in the middle and then dip in and out of the beginning and end. Or if you track your own crazy, haphazard course through the text as a whole.\nThe rights of the reader At first, this feels counter-intuitive and unseemly. It isn\u0026rsquo;t how we have been taught to read. We imagine our teachers looking over our shoulders as we flip to page four hundred and something, saying sternly, “Maybe you should start at the beginning…”\nThen again, maybe you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. In his brilliant little book The Rights of the Reader (or, in the French original, Comme Un Roman), Daniel Pennac argues for the sovereign right of readers to approach books how they wish. One of the things that stops us reading is the lurking sense that we\u0026rsquo;re doing it wrong, and that in reading this way or that, we are going to be judged.\nHere are Pennac\u0026rsquo;s ten rights.\nThe right not to read\nThe right to skip\nThe right not to finish a book\nThe right to re-read\nThe right to read anything\nThe right to mistake a book for real life\nThe right to read anywhere\nThe right to dip in\nThe right to read out loud\nThe right to be silent\nThe first right here—the right not to read—is an important one. Sometimes we think we need to read not individual books, but instead whole traditions, in a systematic fashion. There will always be people who tell you, for example, that you have to read Kant\u0026rsquo;s Critique of Pure Reason. But Plato did not read Kant. Neither did Aristotle. So it\u0026rsquo;s clearly not obligatory. It might be that reading Kant will help you think through some particular issues. And there are many good reasons to read Kant. But in most normal circumstances (outside of university courses, for example) it\u0026rsquo;s not compulsory.\nSo when plotting a course through philosophy, if you pick up a book and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t speak to you, you should feel free to read another. Or you should feel free to do something else that is not reading: go for a walk, hang out with the cats, bake a cake.\nBut once you\u0026rsquo;ve decided you are going to read a particular book, you are still not obliged to read that one book in any particular way, or any particular order. At least three of Pennac\u0026rsquo;s rights—the right to skip, the right not to finish a book, the right to dip in—are about giving yourself permission to plot your own journey as you read. And this process of finding your own idiosyncratic approach to reading, wilfully and systematically, __ can be fruitful in all kinds of interesting ways.\nUtagawa Kuniyoshi, woman and children reading. 19th century. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons. Reading haphazardly, dipping in, skipping and not finishing are all perfectly acceptable strategies for reading philosophy. You can use philosophy books like divinatory tools, opening them at random to see if they spark a fresh thought. You can start with the final chapter—with a sense of where the journey has taken the writer—and then work back chapter-by-chapter to the beginning. Or you can describe elaborate loops and arcs, moving now in one direction and now in another. All these ways of reading can lead to interesting new thoughts and possibilities, even if these were not what the author themselves intended or wished for.\nWays of not reading One of the major problems we have when reading philosophy is that we suffer from a myth about what it means to read. We ask each other, “Have you read this book?” Or we say proudly, “I have read the complete works of Søren Kierkegaard.” Then we pause and add, “In Danish.” But we don\u0026rsquo;t often stop to ask what it means to have read something.\nIn How to Talk About Books You Haven\u0026rsquo;t Read, the writer Pierre Bayard says that although we\u0026rsquo;d like to “draw a clear line between reading and not reading,” in reality, this line is blurred. Bayard gives a fourfold classification of books:\nBooks that are unknown to us Books we have skimmed Books we have heard of Books we have forgotten Bayard avoids including a category for books we have actually read. After all, what does it mean to say we have read something? That we have memorised every word? That we have a general sense of what the book is about? Or something else? Bayard writes, “What we take to be the books we have read, is in fact an anomalous accumulation of fragments of texts, reworked by our imagination.”\nThis is even true of the things we have ourselves written. Thinking back on my own books, I realise that most of what I\u0026rsquo;ve written I\u0026rsquo;ve now forgotten. Human memory is frail. So while I can give you a general sense of what these books are about, and I can tell you a couple of stories from each of them, I probably misremember as much as I remember (this is why picking up books you have written a decade later can be both surprising and sometimes uncomfortable).\nIf this is the case even with things we ourselves have written, what hope is there for getting to grips with, or exhaustively understanding, books by other writers? Even the simplest of books is a big, complex thing. It is the nexus of a whole bunch of relationships: with readers, with ideas, with other books, with other things. To thoroughly, exhaustively read a book would be to grasp the whole, complex set of relationships of which the book you are reading is a part. And that is impossible. Nobody has ever exhaustively or completely read a book. Not even the author.\nSo when we pick up Kant\u0026rsquo;s work, for example, out of necessity we find ourselves reading in ways he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have read it—and perhaps couldn\u0026rsquo;t have read it. There is no such thing as a non-idiosyncratic way of reading (even if some idiosyncrasies are deemed more socially acceptable than others, for good reasons or ill).\nReaders and purposes If there is no single, preordained “right” way to read a book, and no way of exhaustively reading a book, this means that as a reader, you have the right to read however you like. So why not experiment with all the wrong ways that you can read? Why not embrace the messy, haphazard complexity of our relationship with the written word, and find your own way, free of obligation?\nBut at this point you might protest: surely there are better and worse ways of reading Plato, or Kant, or Hannah Arendt? Well, maybe. But the question here is better or worse for what? How we read is intimately related to why we read. It is a matter of our intentions and interests. If there is no single best way of reading a philosophy book, this is because we read philosophy for different purposes and to different ends. And getting clear about these purposes and ends can open up new ways of reading.\nBut that\u0026rsquo;s a topic for the next article in this series, where I\u0026rsquo;ll be asking what it means to read self-interestedly.\nRead the whole series on seven ways of reading philosophy\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "content": "A complicated business\u0026hellip; Of all areas of human life, sex is one of the most complicated. It is the place where biology, culture, ideas of the good life and weighty moral claims collide. Questions about sex are one of the great human preoccupations. Questions like: How much sex should we have? Should we have as much as possible? Or—like the Buddhist monks, wary of desire—should we choose to abstain? Whom should we have sex with? Just ourselves? With just one other person, a life-partner or spouse? With a succession of short-term partners? With a range of people, by mutual consent and agreement? With anybody who is up for it? And, for that matter, who shouldn\u0026rsquo;t we have sex with? Then there are questions about when we should (or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t) have sex, and how we should (or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t) have it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s probably no culture on earth that hasn\u0026rsquo;t developed cultures of sex—often of baroque complexity—to try and manage all this. And even if none of these questions—the question “how much?”, the question “whom?”, the question “when?” and the question “how?”—are directly philosophical questions, they all harbour deeper philosophical issues that go to the heart of how we understand ourselves, each other, what society is or could be, and what it means to be human.\nBut where do you even start with untangling all of this? In this week\u0026rsquo;s article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start by asking some questions about our underlying biology. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll ask some questions about sexual ethics. And finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll ask about the problems caused by the gender imbalance of the philosophical traditions that have come down to us, and how the philosophy of sex and desire needs to think beyond the constraints of this tradition to address the questions that are at stake.\nYou and me baby ain\u0026rsquo;t nothin\u0026rsquo; but mammals… But let\u0026rsquo;s start by going back to questions of biology. Given the sheer cultural complexity of sex, this seems a not unreasonable starting point. In the first week of this series, we saw how philosopher Carrie Jenkins describes love as “ancient biological machinery embodying a modern social role.”[1] So if we go back to our underlying biological machinery, perhaps here we might find a base-level simplicity that can help us anchor all the complexity.\nSo, we\u0026rsquo;re going to start by putting to one side the complex questions of social roles and the part played by culture in organising our desires and our sexual lives. And we\u0026rsquo;re going to go back to biology to see how human sexual desire plays out in ways that are continuous with the way sexual desire plays out elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Because, as the Bloodhound Gang once put it, “You and me baby ain\u0026rsquo;t nothin\u0026rsquo; but mammals / So let\u0026rsquo;s do it like they do on the Discovery Channel.”\nNoah\u0026rsquo;s Ark, oil on canvas painting by Edward Hicks, 1846 Philadelphia Museum of Art. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nBut if we hope that this return to biology would return us to a simpler, even more innocent, view of what it means to be a sexual being, it is likely that we will be disappointed. Although some moralists might like to imagine the animal world as a place of sexual good order—with the animals going into the ark two-by-two—the reality is starkly different. The more we get to know about how sexual desire plays out in the rest of the animal kingdom, the more it becomes clear that sexual desire and sexual pleasure are complex almost everywhere, not just among human beings.\nProcreation or recreation? Among human beings, sex is both procreation and recreation: mostly the latter, occasionally the former. And it is easy to imagine that recreational sex aligns with culture, while procreational sex is about nature and is a matter of our biology. After all, we\u0026rsquo;re evolved to pass on our genes, and sex is evolution\u0026rsquo;s way of gene-mixing (see this nice overview of the evolutionary costs and benefits of sex). This tendency to separate sex as a means of procreation and sex as a means of recreation often aligns with a broader narrative that divides off nature and culture.\nIn the Christian philosophical tradition, there has been a long-standing claim that procreation is the natural function of sex. This makes sex as recreation morally problematic, particularly when it comes unstuck from the context of its procreative function—hence the idea that homosexuality, masturbation and other non-procreative forms of sex are morally problematic.\nThe medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) argued that sexual pleasure in itself was not evil, but the pursuit of sexual pleasure as an end in itself, or for its own sake, was morally problematic. The only legitimate expression of sexual pleasure, Aquinas argued, was when it took place in the context of a married relationship, with the knowledge that the natural purpose of sex is procreation:\nNow just as the preservation of the bodily nature of one individual is a true good, so, too, is the preservation of the nature of the human species a very great good. And just as the use of food is directed to the preservation of life in the individual, so is the use of venereal acts directed to the preservation of the whole human race. Hence Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xvi): \u0026ldquo;What food is to a man\u0026rsquo;s well being, such is sexual intercourse to the welfare of the whole human race.\u0026rdquo; Wherefore just as the use of food can be without sin, if it be taken in due manner and order, as required for the welfare of the body, so also the use of venereal acts can be without sin, provided they be performed in due manner and order, in keeping with the end of human procreation. [2]\nBut appeals to the natural function of sex as a form of procreation obscure the fact that in the rest of the animal kingdom, sex is often just as much about recreation.\nIn his wonderful book Pleasurable Kingdom, Jonathan Balcombe writes about the sexual exuberance of the animal kingdom. Many animals have been observed having sex in ways that have no chance of producing offspring: from collared peccaries to warthogs, and from koalas to chaffinches. Oral sex is seen across the animal kingdom. Masturbation is common in mammals, among males and females equally. It has even been observed in birds. Homosexuality is common too. Male giraffes literally neck, twining their necks around each other as they bring each other to orgasm. And as for alternative family units, among certain species of gulls, it is not uncommon for female couples to raise chicks together, while the wayward father acts just as a sperm donor. Meanwhile, creatures as varied as dolphins, herons, and swallows have been observed to have orgies (though not all together, all at the same time), engaging in group sex for fun. And inter-species sexual activity is far from unheard-of—a recent example being the liaisons between macaques and sika deer in Japan. And so it goes on. As Balcombe writes:\nWhen we look closely we find that the animal kingdom is a sexy place, where carnality finds expression in many forms. Animals are neither priggish nor especially shy. We need only watch patiently, and try not to blush. [3]\nAnd this is why the increasing amount of data on the sexual exuberance of the rest of the animal kingdom are so important. These data show us how the tendency to divide human sexual practices into “natural” and “unnatural” is a poor foundation for thinking through human sexual ethics. Here as elsewhere, using what we deem to be natural as a criterion for what is ethical is an unpromising line of approach.\nThe ethics of desire The philosophy of sex is as complex and sprawling as human sexuality itself. And although this philosophy is not reducible to ethical questions, nevertheless, when we talk about sex it is often questions of ethics that are at the forefront. We are deeply preoccupied with questions of how we should manage what it is to be a sexual being (or—because it\u0026rsquo;s much more fun to subject others to ethical scrutiny than it is to do the same to ourselves—how other people should manage what it is to be a sexual being). This is not surprising. From one point of view, sexual desire seems to bring in its wake all kinds of individual and social harms and sufferings. From another point of view, it brings immense pleasure and can seem to be a source of creativity.\nFor some thinkers—for example, Saint Augustine (354-430) in the Christian tradition, and the Buddha in the Indian tradition—sexual desire is almost always morally problematic. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804), the least sexy of philosophers, claims that sex is an issue because it turns the object of our desires into precisely that: an object. Kant writes, with unusual pungency, that:\nIn loving from sexual inclination, they make the person into an object of their appetite. As soon as the person is possessed, and the appetite sated, they are thrown away, as one throws away a lemon after sucking the juice from it. [4]\nDrawing, Lemons and Lemon Blossoms in a Basket, 18th century. Unknown artist. From the Smithsonian Design Museum. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nAgainst this view, some philosophers have argued that sex is potentially creative: not just procreative, but itself a creative act. It creates pleasure. It forges social bonds (with us as elsewhere in the animal kingdom). And it opens us up to new experiences. The 2nd-century Indian text, the Kama Sutra, has this to say about kama, or desire.\nKama is the mind’s inclination towards objects which a person’s senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell find congenial. Its principal element is a delightful, creative feeling pervaded by sensual pleasure and derived in particular from the sense of touch. [5]\nSo perhaps instead of asking whether sexual desire and sexual activity are themselves morally good or bad, it might be more helpful to ask about the ethics of how these things play out within human life, so we can harness what creative potential sex might have in human life while avoiding as far as possible the harms that it may bring.\nRethinking love and sex And here there\u0026rsquo;s a good argument to be made for broadening out the philosophical tradition. Most of the philosophical traditions that have come down to us are marked by a substantial gender imbalance. Even when, in Plato\u0026rsquo;s dialogues on love in the Symposium, the woman philosopher Diotima is cited, she is only mentioned second-hand, her ideas channelled through the storytelling of Socrates. And many of the male philosophers throughout the tradition are preoccupied exclusively with male sexual desire and male sexual activity. Even when they claim to be talking more broadly, the absence of women\u0026rsquo;s voices means that the account they are giving is only partial. As bell hooks writes in her brilliant All About Love:\nEarlier in my life, I read books about love and never thought about the gender of the writer. Eager to understand what we mean when we speak of love, I did not really consider the extent to which gender shaped a writer’s perspective. It was only when I began to think seriously about the subject of love and to write about it that I pondered whether women do this differently from men. [6]\nMore recently, there has been a substantial amount of philosophical work by women philosophers that aims to redress this balance because if we are going to think about love and sex and what they mean philosophically, we need to account for the whole breadth of human experience.\nSo perhaps I should end with Carrie Jenkins, and her book What Love Is and What it Could Be, which argues for the potentially revolutionary effects of allowing in a wider range of voices, and exploring more diverse ways of managing our sexual, romantic and personal lives. “Nonconformity can change the world,” Jenkins writes.[7] And so Jenkins argues that if we want to change things, then the onus is on us to “choose our own adventure,” to think more deeply and more responsibly about sex, to be more honest with ourselves and each other, to reduce the harms that sex can cause, and meanwhile to harness as much creativity as we possibly can.\nDiscussion Questions Are there any circumstances in which, in relation to sex, the division between what is natural and what is unnatural makes sense? How much do you think our increasing knowledge of what I\u0026rsquo;ve called the “sexual exuberance” of the rest of the animal kingdom should influence our ideas of human nature, particularly in relation to sex? Or is there something about human distinctiveness that makes this data less than relevant? Is Kant right about objectification? And if so, is objectification always bad? (See this song by Jeffrey Lewis and the Junkyard). In what ways is sexual desire creative? In what ways is it harmful?

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "When reading philosophy, the advice is often to read slowly and carefully, tortoise-style, making sure you understand every point before going on to the next. But in this article — the second in my ongoing series on how to read philosophy — I want to persuade you that this can sometimes be the very worst approach. And to do so, I\u0026rsquo;m going to take my lead from the German philosopher Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929).\nHow to read better Rosenzweig is a fascinating thinker. His most famous book is The Star of Redemption, which he started writing while he was serving in the German army on the Balkan front. He sent the text back home scribbled on army postcards and completed the book after the war ended. The book was published in 1921. Rosenzweig intended it to be a new way of doing philosophy, based in what he called Sprachdenken, or “speech-thinking,” a kind of thinking that is closely related to storytelling. But after it was published, Rosenzweig\u0026rsquo;s book was met with general incomprehension. So in 1925, Rosenzweig wrote an essay called The New Thinking, where he tried to explain what he was up to. And along the way, he made a fascinating argument about how we read philosophy (including his own book) all wrong.\nIn his essay, Rosenzweig argues that when we read philosophy, we make the mistake of imagining that what we are reading is “especially logical.” We imagine that the ideas in the text will follow each other in neat chains of reasoning, with each sentence leading on to the next. We think that if we start at the beginning and work through systematically, making sure we understand every sentence before moving on to the next, we\u0026rsquo;ll get the hang of what is going on. But the reality is, “Nowhere is this less the case than in philosophical books.”[1] For Rosenzweig, there is something story-like about how we come to understand philosophy. We start at the beginning, sunk in confusion and mystery. And clarity only emerges as the story unfolds. This is how Rosenzweig puts it:\nHere [i.e. in philosophy books] a sentence does not follow from the preceding one, but more likely from the one following. Whoever has not understood a sentence or a paragraph is little helped if, in the conscientious belief that they must not leave anything behind that is not understood, they read it again and again or even start over again.\nInstead of reading carefully, understanding each sentence on the basis of the one before, Rosenzweig suggests a different approach. We should charge ahead, he says. Philosophy books, “want to be conquered Napoleonically, in a bold attack on the enemy\u0026rsquo;s central force, upon the conquest of which the small outlying fortifications will fall automatically.”\nOr, as he puts it a couple of pages later, when reading philosophy, “Above all: rush! Do not stop!”\nPitting our wits against Wittgenstein Let\u0026rsquo;s take an example. Like The Star of Redemption, Wittgenstein\u0026rsquo;s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus started life when its author was drafted into the army in the First World War. But other than this, the two books couldn\u0026rsquo;t be more different. Rosenzweig\u0026rsquo;s book seems dauntingly elliptical. In contrast, the Tractatus seems like a model of good order. With its tidy numbered paragraphs, it certainly looks clear and logical.\nAnd yet, if you launch in and read through the first half of the first page—particularly if you are new to philosophy—things soon become pretty perplexing.\n1.The world is all that is the case1.1The world is the totality of facts, not of things.1.11The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts1.12For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case.1.13The facts in logical space are the world. [2]\n“The world is all that is the case…” Okay, you think. This kind of makes sense. So you go to the next paragraph, which seems to be a comment on the first.\n“The world is the totality of facts, not of things” (1.1). But, you ask yourself, what are “facts” and what are “things”? It\u0026rsquo;s not clear, at least not yet. You shrug and press on to the next paragraph, which seems to be a comment on the paragraph before.\n“The world is determined by the facts, and by their being all the facts” (1.11). Has this made things clearer? Or has it made them muddier? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to be sure. But, hold on…! What\u0026rsquo;s next?\n“For the totality of facts determines what is the case, and also whatever is not the case” (1.12). You think this might be saying something new. But then again, it might be saying the same thing differently. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to tell.\nNext you read, “The facts in logical space are the world” (1.13). By now, you are fewer than sixty words in, and you are already baffled.\nAt this point, the temptation might be to go back to the beginning, and read these sixty words again, or even to read them repeatedly until they make some kind of sense. After all, if you can\u0026rsquo;t understand the first sixty words, what chance do you have of understanding the next sixty, and the sixty after that? But, taking advice from Rosenzweig, this is almost certainly the wrong approach. Instead, when you start to get bogged down, it is precisely then that you should put on your Tricorn hat and gallop onwards, as Napoleon would.\nRemember this: Above all, don\u0026rsquo;t stop!\nMary Read, Pirate Queen. Print dated c. 1710. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons. And then, once you pick up the pace of the reading, you start to find that things fall into place. For example, when you know that for Wittgenstein “What is the case—a fact—is the existence of states of affairs” (proposition 2), this throws light on proposition 1.1 (“The world is the totality of facts, not of things”). And once you know that “We picture facts to ourselves” (proposition 2.1), you can make more sense of what Wittgenstein means when he talks about facts, and when he talks about the world.\nSo on you gallop, until you get to the famous final proposition, “What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence” (proposition 7); and at this point, if your Napoleonic campaign is successful, the light will have come on. “Aha!” you say to yourself. “So that\u0026rsquo;s what Wittgenstein is up to!”\nPhilosophy at a gallop But this article isn\u0026rsquo;t really about Wittgenstein. Instead, it is about how to read philosophy. And for Rosenzweig, reading philosophy fast, reading it at a gallop, is often the very best way. Rosenzweig writes:\nThus, whoever does not understand something can most assuredly expect enlightenment if they courageously go on reading. The reason why this rule is difficult for the beginner, and [\u0026hellip;] also for many a non-beginner to accept, lies in the fact that thinking and writing are not the same. In thinking, one stroke really strikes a thousand connections. In writing, these thousand must be artfully and cleanly arranged on the string of thousands of lines.\nRemember that for Rosenzweig, the way that philosophical arguments unfold is a kind of “speech thinking.” Philosophy is a kind of storytelling. Like stories, philosophical arguments unfold with a beginning, middle and end. And it is only when you can see all these different parts that you can make sense of the whole.\nWhen you read a story, you know that at the beginning you are not going to know what is happening. You may be lost, intrigued, baffled or fascinated. But you probably won\u0026rsquo;t have full comprehension. That is the point of a story. And that\u0026rsquo;s the fun of it too. So you keep on reading because you know that it is only when you get to the end of the story (“What we cannot speak about we must pass over in silence”) that you will be able to see how the whole thing fits together. __\nSo when reading philosophy, and when things seem difficult and make no sense, this is the time to mount your horse and head into the fray, overflowing with fearless energy.\nBut, you might ask, what if you get to the end of the _Tractatus—_or any other philosophy book—and find you have galloped out the other side without any of the major fortresses falling? What if you get to the end, and are still as baffled as before?\nWell, that\u0026rsquo;s fine too. Because nothing is lost. You and your horse have had a good work-out. The ride has been exhilarating. Even though you have failed to understand, but haven\u0026rsquo;t wasted hours in failing to understand. And when you go head back into the enemy territory at a later date, ready to launch a more strategic attack on those philosophical fortresses, you will do so with a stronger sense of the lie of the land.\nRead the whole series on seven ways of reading philosophy\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "content": "Introduction The Daodejing or Classic of Ways and Powers is one of the most translated of all Chinese texts. It is traditionally attributed to the Daoist sage Laozi (also written Lao Tzu),\nAt just over 5000 characters long, the Daodejing is a masterpiece of compression. But due to its brevity and its elliptical style, it has been read in a multitude of different ways: as everything from a mystical treatise to a hard-headed work about statecraft.\nLife But what about Laozi, the Daodejing\u0026rsquo;s purported author? The name “Laozi” literally means “Old Master.” The Chinese tradition says that Laozi\u0026rsquo;s given name was Li Er, and some accounts make him a contemporary of Confucius. However, over the last century scholars have increasingly cast doubt on the historicity of Li Er. And even if there was a historical individual called Li Er, his connection with the Daodejing is probably tenuous.\nThe sage and the ox But as usual, where history remains silent, stories proliferate. The legendary accounts make Laozi a librarian in the court of Zhou. It was a role that gave him time to read the thoughts of the ancients, and thus to cultivate wisdom. The historian Sima Qian tells us Laozi eventually got sick of court life, and at the age of eighty headed west to the frontier regions to live as a hermit. At the frontier, a guard apprehended the philosopher, refusing to let him travel onwards until he had passed on his wisdom. So Laozi recited the Daodejing and the border-guard wrote it down. Then the Old Master continued on his way west, riding on the back of an ox, and he was lost to history.\nSome accounts even go so far as to say that after heading west from China, Laozi ended up in India, where he became a teacher of the Buddha. Like everything else about Laozi\u0026rsquo;s “biography”, there is no evidence that any of this is true.\nPhilosophy: Dao and De Ways and words Laozi\u0026rsquo;s text, the Daodejing, explores two concepts in particular: dao and de (sometimes written tao and te). Both are tricky to translate, and both subject to considerable debate. The Daodejing begins with the famous sentence :\nThe dao that you can dao is not the constant dao.\nThe word dao in Chinese can mean both “way” or “path.” But it can also mean “to speak” or “to talk about.” So one common way of translating the opening sentence is to take the first and third dao as meaning “way” and the second as meaning “to talk about”:\nThe way you can talk about is not the constant way.\nIn this reading, the dao, the natural way of things, is something that escapes all our attempts to speak of it.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s a problem here. When translating dao into English as “the” dao, we risk imagining that the dao is some kind of metaphysical entity: something big, important and deeply mysterious. However, the definite article does not exist in the original Chinese. So dao can mean the dao, or a dao, or even daos, in the plural. This means that you could also translate the first line as follows:\nWays you can talk about are not constant ways.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s also another level of ambiguity as well, because it is possible to read the second dao not as “to say” or “to talk about”, but as a verb related to the noun “way” or “path.” Reading it like this, “to dao” would mean something like “to tread a path”, “to make your way”, or “to lead.” This would give us something like the following:\nWays you can tread are not constant ways.\nIf you read it like this, the text might be saying that the paths we take as we make our way through the world—the paths that remain open to us—are always subject to change. You can take a particular path today, but that same path may not be open tomorrow (this recalls Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s claim that you can\u0026rsquo;t step into the same river twice). To keep on moving, if you are a skilful wayfarer, you need to be able to recognise the inconstancy of the paths you are on. You need to be vigilant. And you need to be flexible. Because if you rely on a pre-ordained and inflexible Way, you will almost certainly stumble.\nPowers and potentials The second concept in the Daodejing is de. In texts from the Confucian tradition, de is often translated as “virtue”; but when it comes to Daoist texts like the Daodejing, something like “potency” is closer to the mark. So you could read de as the potency or potential that a thing has by virtue of being the kind of thing that it is. The de of a fish is the potential it has to be a fish, to do fishy things. The de of a tree is the potential it has to exist—or even to flourish—as a tree. And so on.\nThe word de goes back to the Zhou dynasty where, according to the scholar Constance A. Cook, it referred to “a fluid inner force available only to those who participated in the ancestral worship system” (see reference below, p. 117). By the time the Daodejing was written, de had lost its connection with ancestor worship. But it maintained this sense of inner force and potency. So if we understand it like this, the aim of the Daodejing is to tell us how to tread paths through an inconstant world whilst protecting our potency and our force.\nUnlike virtue, de is not something you practice. The moment you start thinking of de as something to be practised or something that you do, you lose sight of it. Instead, it is something that comes through allowing your potential to express itself through wuwei or non-action. Here\u0026rsquo;s how Edward Slingerland translates the passage in the Daodejing (translating de as “virtue”):\nThe highest Virtue [de] does not try to be virtuous, and so really possesses Virtue.The worst kind of Virtue never stops striving for Virtue, and so never achieves Virtue.The person of highest Virtue does not act [wu-wei] and does not reflect upon what he is doing.\nFor the Daodejing, the optimal way of being is allowing our de to fully express itself by refusing all kinds of forcing and striving. Only when we remove ourselves from striving can our de, or potency, be fulfilled. And then, full of life, we can continue on our own idiosyncratic way, making new pathways as we navigate our passage through the world.\nFurther Reading Books Lots of translations of the Daodejing are available. Try the ones by David Hinton or Philip Ivanhoe.\nConstance A. Cook\u0026rsquo;s essay “Which Comes First? Dao 道 or De 德: Evidence from the Guodian Manuscripts” is in chapter six of Dao Companion to the Excavated Guodian Bamboo Manuscripts, ed. Shirley Chan (Springer 2019).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a readable introduction to the Daodejing as a philosophical text by Hans-Georg Moeller called The Philosophy of the Daodejing (Columbia University Press 2006)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s really worth reading Edward Slingerland\u0026rsquo;s Trying Not to Try (Penguin 2015), which explores the idea of wuwei across the different traditions of ancient China, and puts it in the context of contemporary cognitive science.\nOnline Resources For an accessible, free translation of the Daodejing with accompanying Chinese text, see the website run by A.

            "content": "Taking your father to court The philosopher Socrates is outside the court in Athens. He has been accused of impiety and corrupting the minds of the youth of the city—a charge for which he will soon be executed. As he is idling in the street outside the courthouse, he comes across an earnest young man called Euthyphro. The young man is bringing a charge of murder against his father, something that is all but unthinkable in Athenian society.\nThe substance of the charge is this. A servant who worked for Euthyphro\u0026rsquo;s father got drunk, and in a fit of anger killed one of the household slaves. Euthyphro\u0026rsquo;s dad took the servant, bound him hand and foot and threw him in a ditch while he decided what to do with him next. Unfortunately, before he could come to a decision, the servant died of hunger.\nSocrates is shocked that Euthyphro is taking his father to court. But Euthyphro defends himself as follows:\nIt is ridiculous, Socrates, for you to think that it makes any difference whether the victim is a stranger or a relative. One should only watch whether the killer acted justly or not; if he acted justly, let him go, but if not, one should prosecute\u0026hellip; [1]\nEuthyphro argues that taking his father to court is the good and pious thing to do, even though under Athenian law only the relatives of the dead can press murder charges. Socrates, who is himself being accused of impiety, seizes on Euthyphro\u0026rsquo;s argument about the universality of justice and gets into a long wrangle with the young man about the nature of piety and goodness and justice, tying Euthyphro up in knots.\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s dialogue is fascinating for a multitude of reasons. But the central tension with which it begins is one that is with us to this day: what happens when we encounter a conflict between our personal affiliations and loves, and the impersonal demands of justice?\nLast week, we saw how we are evolved to live in small face-to-face societies. And for human beings living in groups like this, most interpersonal relationships can be negotiated on an ad hoc basis. But when scale things up, then things get more complicated. Then a tension opens up between the affiliations we have with those closest to us, and the demands of living in society with people most of whom are strangers.\nGong and the missing sheep There\u0026rsquo;s an even starker version of the problem faced by Euthyphro and Socrates in the Analects of Confucius.\nThe Duke of She said to Confucius, “Among my people there is one we call ‘Upright Gong.’ When his father stole a sheep, he reported him to the authorities.”\nConfucius replied, “Among my people, those who we consider ‘upright’ are different from this: fathers cover up for their sons, and sons cover up for their fathers. ‘Uprightness’ is to be found in this.”[2]\nZhao Mengfu (1271–1368), Sheep and Goat, Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nFor Confucius, the demand that fathers should \u0026ldquo;cover up\u0026rdquo; for their sons, and vice versa (the Chinese word yin literally means \u0026ldquo;to hide\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to conceal\u0026rdquo;) is a crucial component of the virtue usually known as filial piety (xiao in Chinese). It\u0026rsquo;s worth taking a moment to see what Confucius is and isn\u0026rsquo;t saying here. He is not saying that the father should not be charged with the crime of stealing a sheep. He is saying that it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be his son who reports him to the authorities.\nOne way of understanding this is in terms of a tension between two kinds of \u0026ldquo;uprightness\u0026rdquo; (or, in Chinese, zhi). On the one hand, there is an uprightness to taking the law seriously. But on the other hand, there is an uprightness to observing the proper relationships with those who are close to you. Of course, we might say, we should obey the law. That is the upright thing to do. And of course, we should also do our best to protect the interests of those to whom we are closest. That too is the upright thing to do. But what happens when these two forms of uprightness come into conflict?\nBut is Confucius really saying we should let those who are close to us get away with anything, simply because they are close to us? This is a reading of the passage that sits awkwardly with Confucius\u0026rsquo;s other teachings. However, there is another reading. In this reading, Confucius recognises that when it comes to strangers or those with whom we don\u0026rsquo;t have personal bonds, it may be appropriate to resort to the law when we encounter wrongdoing. But when it comes to our intimates and those we are personally connected with, when we encounter wrongdoing, our first port of call shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be impersonal law. Instead, we should resort to other methods to help bring our wayward relatives in line.\nSometimes people think about Confucian filial piety as being exclusively about obedience. But the scholar Yong Huang points out that a crucial component of filial piety is remonstration. An example is in the following passage from the Family Sayings of Confucius or Kongzi Jiayu.\nIn ancient times, when a good king of a big state has seven ministers who dare to remonstrate, the king will not make mistakes; if a middle sized state has five remonstrating ministers, the state will have no danger; if a small state has three remonstrating ministers, the official salaries and positions can last. If a father has a remonstrating child, he will not fall into doing things without propriety; and if a scholar has a remonstrating friend, he will not do immoral things. So how can a son who merely obeys the parents be regarded as being filial, and a minister who merely obeys the ruler be regarded as being loyal? To be filial and loyal is to examine what to follow. [3]\nWhen it comes to a serious transgression—murder, for example—we may disagree that remonstration is the best first option. But for more minor transgressions, this goes with our instincts. If your child (or parent) stole a bar of chocolate from the small shop around the corner, it would be weird to immediately resort to impersonal justice as a way to right this wrong, and to drive them to the nearest police station. Instead, our instincts are probably that the right thing to do is to remonstrate with them, point out that stealing chocolate is probably not the best thing to do, and persuade them to take the chocolate back to the shop.\nThe challenge of universal love For Confucius, it is entirely right that we respond differently to those who are closest to us. For each of us, our intimates form a circle of care and specific moral concern. And this is consistent with the idea of Dunbar\u0026rsquo;s number that we explored in last week\u0026rsquo;s article: the idea that human beings are adapted to keep track of a small handful of close intimates.\nAs a way of ordering society, this makes sense. We can\u0026rsquo;t care for everyone\u0026rsquo;s grandmother. But we might hope to live in a society where everybody cares for their own grandmother. You could see this Confucian view of society as an affiliation of interlocking units, each of these units bound by a sense of the proper relationships of care and moral concern. If this system worked as it should, then the need for laws and punishments, Confucius believed, would be minimal or even non-existent. If rulers set the right moral tone for their subjects, and their ministers held them morally to account, if parents set the right moral tone for their children, and their children held them to account, the society would function well.\nBut not everyone in ancient China agreed. The philosopher Mozi, who flourished around 430 BCE, was concerned that the partiality at the heart of Confucian ethics could too easily lead to self-interest and disorder. Instead, he argued in favour of what he called jian ai, or “universal love.” For Mozi and his followers (known as Mohists), universal love requires that we should respond equally and impartially to all other, regardless of the closeness of our connection. Confucian moral concern, the Mohists claimed, is blinkered and narrow.\nMozi\u0026rsquo;s starting point for his argument is that human societies fall into disorder because of a lack of love. The reason that you go out in the first place to steal that chocolate bar, or to steal that sheep, is a lack of love. You have not fully taken on board the interests of the sheep-owner, or the shop-owner. Acts like this are a failure of imagination, but they are also a failure of love. If you have sufficient love for others, this means you are unwilling to disadvantage them for your own advantage.\nThis is how Mozi makes his argument:\nA sage, in taking the ordering of the world to be his business, must examine what disorder arises from. In his attempts, what does he discover disorder to arise from? It arises from lack of mutual love\u0026hellip; Even if we come to those who are thieves and robbers in the world the same applies insofar as they love their own household but do not love the households of others. Therefore, they plunder other households in order to benefit their own households. A robber loves himself but not others. Therefore he robs others in order to benefit himself. How is this? In all cases it arises through want of mutual love. [4]\nWhat Mozi calls love is the ability to take others\u0026rsquo; interests into account, and to see these interests as having equal weight with our own interests and the interests of those close to us. Mozi\u0026rsquo;s jian ai is, in many ways, about justice, about how to manage the competing interests of different members of society. But the fact that Mozi talks about love suggests that this is more than just an intellectual principle of balancing out our interests against the interests of others. Instead, it is the idea that it is possible for us to have a feelingful and meaningful connection with the interests of those outside our narrow circle.\nWhat society depends on The problem with Mozi\u0026rsquo;s demand for universal love is, as Mozi himself admits, that it is very difficult. And one thing that makes it difficult, as we saw in the previous piece, is that we are not really equipped to cope with more than a small circle of one hundred and fifty others.\nAnd this fact reminds us that in one sense, the rift between Mohism and Cofucianism is not as large as it might at first seem. The Mohists and the Confucians both know that we are partial, and that our concerns are partial. And they are both aware that broader systems of moral norms are important for a well-functioning society. What they differ on, above all else, is whether we should struggle to overcome our partiality, and what role law should play in our societies.\nFor the Mohists, if we want our societies to function well, it is important to manage our tendencies to partiality, and to put in place policies that encourage all those who live in that society to extend out the circle of their caring. And here we come to a surprising aspect of the disagreement between the Confucians and the Mohists. For Confucius, if our tendency for partial love is well-regulated by virtue and ritual, there is little need for legal systems of reward and punishment: our natural moral concern for those we love is all that we need for a well-functioning society. In the Analects, Confucius claims that:\nIf you try to guide the common people with coercive regulations and keep them in line with punishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no sense of shame. If, however, you guide them with virtue, and keep them in line by means of ritual, the people will have a sense of shame and will rectify themselves. [5]\nThere is an argument here that the ideal for Confucius is a kind of anarchism, but an anarchism of a weird kind. In this Confucian anarchist model, the system recognises multiple hierarchies. But the connections we have with each other are regulated by custom, ritual and virtue, rather than by law.\nBut for the Mohists, this idea is fanciful. No society has ever functioned like this. So if we want to encourage universal love, we need strict laws in place to police it:\nNow things like universal mutual love and the exchange of mutual benefit are both beneficial and easy to practise in innumerable ways. I think it is only a matter of not having a ruler who delights in them, and that is all. If there was a ruler who delighted in these things, and encouraged people with rewards and praise, and intimidated them with penalties and punishments, I think the people would take to universal mutual love and interchange of mutual benefit just like fire goes up and water goes down and cannot be stopped in the world. [6]\nWhether we think Mozi has it right, or whether we go with Confucius, between them, these two thinkers set out a tension that to this day is still hard to resolve. On the one hand, we are partial beings, evolved to live in small social groups where we love and care deeply for our intimates. But on the other hand, we are members of larger-scale societies where the needs of others conflict with our own partial caring.\nHow do we take into account the needs of others, many of whom we might never meet? Whom should we love? Why and how should we care? And what role should law have in making sure that we care?\nQuestions If somebody close to you, or somebody you loved, had committed a serious crime, what would you do? Would you report them, or would you try to remonstrate with them? And what do you think the right thing to do would be? Now think about the same question, but with a minor transgression (like stealing a chocolate bar). How do your answers change? And another question following on from the last two: where is the boundary, if any, between transgressions where you would favour interpersonal affiliation and love over broader concerns with justice? What is a more plausible basis for a well-ordered society: the model given by Confucius of graded concern, or the model given by Mozi of universal love? Why do you think this? Are the two models necessarily opposed to each other? Or can you find a way to harmonise them? Notes [1] Euthyphro 4c, in John M.

            "content": "Philosophy can often appear to be a daunting subject. All those great minds! All those long words! All those endless sentences that go on for half a page! The popular image of philosophy—an image that some philosophers are reluctant to dispel—is that it is an unusually difficult pursuit. And so perhaps it is not surprising that many readers sit down to read philosophy full of good intentions, only to find themselves grinding to a halt in a strange cocktail of frustration, inadequacy, and despair.\nHow (not) to read philosophy If you look at most online guides to reading philosophy, they tell you that to read philosophy, you need to be particularly methodical. First, you find a quiet place to settle down, free from distraction. Next, you muster all your high-minded seriousness. Then you start at the first page and work through sentence by sentence, making sure you understand each one before you move on to the next. You identify the philosopher\u0026rsquo;s arguments. You try to work out what their theses are. You think about what the premises are and what the conclusions are. You single out key terms and look them up. You make careful notes. And thus you proceed through the great work—as methodical as a giant tortoise munching its way through the contents of the salad bar—as the sun of understanding slowly dawns.\nAnd all this is okay. In fact, it is probably good advice. But only if you have the patience of a tortoise, or if you are that kind of reader. But not all readers are the same. And failing to appreciate this is one reason that many readers of philosophy fall at the first hurdle. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to read philosophy in this tortoise-like fashion. Sometimes, there are better ways of reading. After all, different ways of reading a book can reveal different aspects of that book\u0026rsquo;s personality or character. And you really are under no obligation to read in any one particular fashion.\nSo in this friendly guide (which is going to stretch over eight different posts, including this one), I\u0026rsquo;m going to suggest some different ways of reading philosophy, and how to read philosophy differently, and perhaps also sometimes more fruitfully.\nAn afternoon with Immanuel Kant But first, let\u0026rsquo;s look at what goes wrong. Imagine that one day, you decide you are going to get to grips with philosophy. So, you go to the bookshop and pick up a serious-looking philosophy book—let\u0026rsquo;s say it is the Critique of Pure Reason by Immanuel Kant. It feels reassuringly heavy in your hand, just the way greatness should feel.\nYou take the book home, and there you tell your family members—relatives, housemates, cats, dogs, cockatiels, whatever—that this afternoon you are going to be reading philosophy, so they will need to look after themselves. Then you shut yourself away with the Critique of Pure Reason, switch your phone to silent, and murmur under your breath, “Okay, Kant\u0026hellip; Let’s be having you…”\nNot knowing where else to start, you begin with page one. First, you read the editor\u0026rsquo;s introduction, which seems to go on forever and doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense, mainly because it seems to assume that you\u0026rsquo;ve already read the book, which you haven\u0026rsquo;t. After the introduction, there is a quote in Latin from somebody called Baco de Verulam. Unfortunately, you don’t know Latin. Nor do you know who this Baco character is (later you look up the name online, and find he is Francis Bacon, who you’ve heard of, but can’t remember anything about). You skip the Latin and continue. Next up, there are a couple of dedications to his Excellency Baron von Zedlitz, whoever he is. They are sweet and slightly fawning.\nBy now, if you are being honest with yourself, you are feeling that time is beginning to drag. You have ploughed through almost one hundred pages, and you haven\u0026rsquo;t really even started on the meat of the book. So now you turn the page to Kant\u0026rsquo;s first preface (there are two, you note, both longer than you would like), and the first sentence is four lines long. It goes like this:\nHuman reason has the peculiar fate in one species of its cognitions that it is burdened with questions which it cannot dismiss, since they are given to it as problems by the nature of reason itself, but which it also cannot answer, since they transcend every capacity of human reason. [1]\nYou read through the over-long sentence several times. You think you might know what Kant is talking about, but you are not sure. You shrug and press on. Maybe it will become clear. But Kant is now talking about metaphysics and dogmatism and despotism and scepticism and anarchy and nomads, and it’s anybody’s guess what is going on. You look at your watch. Time is moving slowly, and you have a headache. You suspect you are succumbing to melancholy (you\u0026rsquo;ve heard it is something philosophers suffer from). But you are also stubborn. You are not going to give up too easily. “Okay,” you mutter to yourself. “I’ll finish the preface, and then call it a day.”\nAs you plough onwards, Kant admits that his book is going to be extremely boring (“treated in dry, merely scholastic manner”). You are outraged. What kind of person writes a book, you ask yourself, and then crows about how boring it is? Then, as if to soften the blow, Kant makes what you think is probably a joke—about books that would be shorter if they were not so short, and books that would be clearer if they had not been made so clear. But if this is a joke, you don\u0026rsquo;t get it. And this only makes you more depressed.\nBy now, you are starting to think you actually hate Kant. And the moment you have this thought, you are ashamed… You suspect your hatred is a sign of your pettiness. It is a sign your intellect is small and cramped, your soul inferior. Then you start to sob, wetting the pages of the Critique of Pure Reason with the hot tears of your frustration.\nYou close the book. You look at your watch. The sun has set. It\u0026rsquo;s time to call it a day. “Okay,” you say to yourself. “I\u0026rsquo;ll return to this tomorrow.” But as you leave the room, you know you will not return. Not tomorrow, not the day after, not next week or next month. If you do return at all, it will not be until after another year or two. Only when you have forgotten the sting of failure will you risk picking up the book again. And then you will repeat the whole process. You will stumble at the same hurdles. You will sob the same hot tears of despair. You will give up hope on the very same page…\nReading differently But it doesn’t have to be like this. And this seven-part guide to reading philosophy aims to show you why. In the forthcoming posts, I want to rid you of your fear of philosophy, and to explore different ways of reading. Because there is more than one way of reading a philosophy book. And it is good to have a range of approaches at your disposal. As a reader of philosophy, what matters at least as much as tortoise-like determination is creativity, suppleness, flexibility, and a willingness to read differently.\nSo over the coming days or weeks, I’m going to explore seven different approaches to reading philosophy. There’s nothing magical about the number seven. I could have gone with thirteen—like Wallace Stevens’s Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird. Or I could have selected one thousand and one ways of reading philosophy, like the One Thousand and One Nights. Because in the end, there are as many ways of reading a philosophy book as there are readers (or even more, if you take into account that any one reader can read the same book in any number of ways).\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s stick with seven, so that these posts (unlike the Critique of Pure Reason) don\u0026rsquo;t go on forever. The seven I have chosen are below. I’ll be dedicating one short article to each. And by the time you get to the end of this series of posts, you should be effectively inoculated against the things that too often get in the way of getting to grips with philosophy: fear, a sense of inadequacy, frustration, and despair.\nRead the whole seven ways of reading philosophy series\u0026hellip; Reading Napoleonically Reading haphazardly Reading self-interestedly Reading out loud Reading drunkenly Reading for laughs Reading with others (forthcoming!)

            "title": "Alcmaeon of Croton, the First Philosopher of Medicine",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life According to Herodotus\u0026rsquo;s Histories, as far back as the sixth century BCE, the city of Croton in the south of Italy was famous as a centre for medicine. And so perhaps it is no surprise this was the home of one of the ancient world\u0026rsquo;s most famous philosophers of medicine, Alcmaeon.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Alcmaeon\u0026rsquo;s life. He was probably born some time in the late sixth century BCE, which would make him a contemporary of the philosopher Parmenides. We know that Alcmaeon\u0026rsquo;s father was called Peirithous and that Alcmaeon wrote a book called On Nature. Later writers tend to count Alcmaeon less as a physician himself, and more as a philosopher, although the boundaries between the two are never clearly drawn.\nHanging out with the Pythagoreans Some later writers have suggested that Alcmaeon was a pupil of Pythagoras or a member of the Pythagorean philosophical school. This is not entirely unlikely: Croton was the centre of the Pythagorean community, and so Alcmaeon would have come into contact with Pythagoreans. But the evidence that he was a follower of Pythagoras is dubious. Aristotle hedges his bets, never explicitly identifying Alcmaeon as a Pythagorean, although he wrote in the Metaphysics that, \u0026ldquo;For Alcmaeon was a young man in Pythagoras’ old age, and his system was pretty much like theirs\u0026rdquo; [1].\nEither way, Aristotle was not a big fan of Alcmaeon. One of his lost works is an attack on Alcmaeon\u0026rsquo;s system: a sign that Alcmaeon was a philosopher whom his successors took seriously, even if they did not agree with him.\nPhilosophy On Nature Several early Greek philosophers, including Anaximander, are said to have written books with the title On Nature. Alcmaeon\u0026rsquo;s own On Nature does not survive, but like many ancient texts, it is possible to piece together some of its contents from the quotations of later writers, and what emerges is a systematic view of health and sickness.\nSickness and the gods In the works of Homer, sudden sickness was often attributed to the gods Apollo and Artemis, with Artemis—according to the translator Emily Wilson—being associated in particular with the deaths of women.[2] There is a good example of this in the Iliad. When the Greek army outside the city of Troy is struck down by sickness, Homer attributes the cause to Apollo\u0026rsquo;s anger at Agamemnon. Supernatural sicknesses require supernatural cures. So the Greeks consult the diviner Calchas, who tells them how to mollify the enraged Apollo; and when they do, the plague subsides.\nGreek vase painting of Achilles tending Patroclus wounded by an arrow. c. 500 BCE. Public domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe birth of naturalistic medicine Alcmaeon broke with this theological understanding of illness. His most significant innovation was that he produced a systematic theory of sickness and health that had no need for the gods. A later account of his theory, recorded by the philosopher Aetius (1st — 2nd century CE) explains it like this:\nAlcmaeon holds that what preserves health is the equality [isonomia] of the powers — moist and dry, cold and hot, bitter and sweet and the rest — and the supremacy [monarchia] of any one of them causes disease; for the supremacy of either is destructive. The cause of disease is an excess of heat or cold; the occasion of it surfeit or deficiency of nourishment; the location of it blood, marrow or the brain. Disease may come about from external causes, from the quality of water, local environment or toil ocr torture. Health, on the other hand, is a harmonious blending of the qualities. [3]\nThe ideas of equality and supremacy are borrowed from the sphere of politics, suggesting that the healthy body is a body that is ordered in the same way as a healthy state, its component powers working in harmony with each other, without any one power becoming paramount and leading to imbalance and disequilibrium.\nKnowledge and inference Another important idea attributed to Alcmaeon is the idea that human knowledge proceeds by inference. For some Greek philosophers such as Parmenides), there is something divine about human knowledge. But for Alcmaeon, understanding is something that we gain incrementally through abstracting from our experience. At the very beginning of his book On Nature, Alcmaeon wrote:\nConcerning things unseen the gods possess clear understanding, but in so far as men can proceed by inference, I say as follows\u0026hellip; [4]\nThe process of coming to understand the world, and the principles that underpin it, do not involve revelation. For Alcmaeon, we get to know the world by means of investigation. So perhaps it is no surprise that there is some evidence that Alcmaeon may have conducted anatomical dissections in his search for a deeper understanding of how the human sense organs work.\nScholars still argue over whether Alcmaeon was really one of the earliest practitioners of human dissection. But either way, he was one of the first thinkers to argue that the centre of our sensation, our cognition and our intellect was the brain rather than the heart. And for this, Alcmaeon has sometimes been called the father of neuroscience.\nNotes [1] Aristotle: Metaphysics, trans. Hugh Lawson-Tancred (Penguin Books 1998). p. 41\n[2] The Odyssey: Homer, trans.

            "title": "We All Stand Together: Love, connection and community (Love #2)",
            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "Social primates Whatever else it might be about, love is about connection. It is about how we relate to each other. It is about how we feel about others, how we think about them, how we connect with them, what we do with them. Love is not so much personal as interpersonal.\nSo one way to make inroads into thinking about love is by thinking about what it means to be live alongside others. One of the fundamental questions for human life is this: how can we live well with our fellow human beings—and with the other beings (animals, gods, spirits, strangers, the dead and so on) with whom we share our lives and our worlds?\nAt root, we are social primates. We like play and mutual grooming and sex. We make friends and alliances. We fall out and make amends. We manage the competing demands of living out the lives we want, and living alongside the others on whom we depend. We snuggle and cuddle, struggle and quarrel. And through all this, we try to live as best we can.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a complicated business being a social primate. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to think about, a lot to process. And the question any self-aware primate one day has to ask themselves is this: How do you best manage all of this complexity?\nThroughout history, human beings have conjured wildly diverse ways of answering this question, and managing all the complex dynamics of living in society.\nConvivial communities When seen in the context of our evolutionary heritage, it is not surprising the philosophy of love is so very complex. We saw in the previous article how love involves both ancient biological machinery and the various roles we assume within the society of which we are a part. But the biological machinery of love is not just about the mechanics of our individual bodies, or about our individual desires. It is also interpersonal. Our biology makes us social.\nBut what does it mean to be a social animal? One way of asking this question would be by asking “what is society?” But the idea of “society” can seem rather abstract. We imagine society as something out there, a coolly rational public realm at odds with the hot and messy private world of our domestic sphere. This can open up a rift between the question of how to live in society, and the more intimate questions and issues we face in our everyday lives: the poking and prodding and tickling and cuddling and annoying and soothing and arguing and gossiping and loving and hating.\nSo in this piece, we\u0026rsquo;re going to think instead in terms of community, and we\u0026rsquo;re going to be asking what makes a human community convivial. I\u0026rsquo;m taking this idea of conviviality from the work of two anthropologists, Joanna Overing and Alan Passes. In their edited collection of essays The Anthropology of Love and Anger: The Aesthetics of Conviviality in Native Amazonia, Overing and Passes use the idea of conviviality as a way of exploring what they call the “aesthetics of community.” [1]\nIn everyday use, “conviviality” might conjure images of living it up, or feasting and carousing. But conviviality goes beyond this. It may of course involve feasts and carouses (who doesn\u0026rsquo;t like the odd feast, or the occasional carouse?), but at the heart of conviviality is the question of what it means to live together (con-vivere). It is about how our communal relationships with each other quiver with life and feeling: with desire, with hope, with difficulty, with love and sometimes with hate.\nAll about communities Philosophical accounts of love often overlook the importance of community and conviviality. In her book All About Love, writer and activist bell hooks complains that contemporary talk about love is often focussed on individuals, couples and nuclear families:\nCommunities sustain life—not nuclear families, or the “couple,” and certainly not the rugged individualist. There is no better place to learn the art of loving than in community.[2]\nAs a starting point for thinking about love, the idea of community has one significant advantage over the idea of the nuclear family, the couple, or the individual. The advantage is that community is a human universal. The fact that we are social communal beings is baked into our biological machinery. Of course, in different societies and cultures we organise our communities in different ways. Some of us live in nuclear families, some of us in more sprawling networks of kinship. Some of us live out our lives as a part of romantic relationships, while others embrace more anarchic structures. But these social and cultural forms are secondary to the fact that we are in community with each other.\nbell hooks. Image by CmonGirl on Wikimedia Commons. Public domain.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s for this reason that I want to start by thinking through the philosophy of love on the basis of community. Our current day notions of the romantic couple and the nuclear family are relatively localised. Not all societies organise themselves in this way. But all human beings everywhere have a concern with what it means to be a sociable, convivial creature, living in society with others.\nSo if we think about love on the basis of community, we don\u0026rsquo;t need to commit ourselves to any one social structure. We don\u0026rsquo;t need to adjudicate on whether the nuclear family is beneficial or whether it is (as bell hooks herself argues) harmful; and the same goes for romantic relationships. Instead, we can sidestep these questions, and get started by thinking about what it means to live with others, convivially, with all the complexity this involves.\nLove in the Amazon The Enxet people of Paraguay provide a compelling account of what it is to be a social being, and how we navigate the challenges of living and loving within a community. Plunging into Enxet philosophy may seem a strange approach to talking about the philosophy of love. Most philosophical accounts of love start out with Plato, and take it from there. But taking a view from elsewhere can help shake up our thinking, and undermine some of our assumptions. So let\u0026rsquo;s see if we can sketch out an Enxet theory of love.\nAccording to the anthropologist Stephen W. Kidd, for the Enxet, the centre of our personhood is found in the wáxok, which is located in the stomach. This may sound exotic, but we too talk about how our identity lies in a physical organ: in the heart that hangs in our chest, or in our brain that nestles in our skull.\nFor the Enxet, emotions are physical changes in the wáxok (just as we might say “my heart is all aflutter”). When we are content, wáxok stretches out; when we are sad, it becomes heavy; when we are afraid, it shivers.\nThe wáxok is not just the seat of emotion. It is also the place where thinking and knowing take place. The Enxet say that the wáxok searches (for example, when you are trying to think of something). It mentions things (when an idea comes to you). It makes fun of things (when you have a rising sense, somewhere in your stomach, that you want to make a joke). The wáxok even turns around and goes back to where it came from (when you change your mind).[3]\nImage of the Paraguayan Gran Chaco region, home to the Enxet. Photo by Ilosuna, Creative Commons license via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe wáxok is also inherently social. It is at the same time personal and interpersonal, and there is no hard boundary between the two. This social wáxok is achieved as you grow from being a baby to a child to an adult. It takes shape through your engagements with others. And when your wáxok is well-formed, this gives you the ability to engage better with others on the basis of love and knowledge.\nA fully formed adult, the Enxet say, is somebody whose wáxok is hápek, or soft. The word hápek can also be used to a semi-inflated football, or a door that is unlocked and therefore easy to open. The ideal way of being is to have a slightly deflated self—a hápek wáxok. This makes you open to others. It allows you to be affected by the sufferings of others, good at spending time with them—sharing with them, eating and drinking together.[4] The person with a good wáxok is knowledgable about love.\nAn Enxet theory of love This talk about the wáxok may seem unfamiliar. It is not, after all, a term you usually find in philosophy textbooks. But it gives us an alternative way in to thinking about the philosophy of love. If we take an Enxet perspective on love, there are several things we can say about what love is:\nLove is rooted in our physical, embodied being: in our gut, where our wáxok resides. Love involves our bodies, our emotions, and our thinking (because the wáxok is where thinking and feeling happen as well). Love is about our built-in sociality: it is both innate and also learned through our relationships with others. And finally—perhaps most importantly—our capacity to love is rooted in our susceptibility to others and the extent to which we can be affected by them. Love needs softness. If we are over-inflated and hard, we cannot love, and we cannot live successfully in society with others. This is beginning to look like a pretty well-formed theory of love.\nThe limits of conviviality: love in the city Image: The Battery by Walter Ufer. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe Enxet account of love is a persuasive starting point for a theory of love, one that does not commit us to any particular social structure. But there is a problem. The Enxet are—or at least were in the past—a small-scale, face-to-face society. Yet most of us do not live like this. For those of us who live in crowded towns and cities where we encounter thousands of others on a daily basis, it is not clear that we can (or even should) be this convivial. When we are so comprehensively outnumbered, how can we be soft—like semi-deflated footballs—with everyone we meet?\nWhen we scale up our communities from the small scale to the large, new problems emerge when thinking about love. Love is complicated enough in the rainforests of the Amazon. But there\u0026rsquo;s a whole new level of complication if you find yourself in a city. The anthropologist Robin Dunbar famously argued we are evolved to keep track of more or less one hundred and fifty other individuals. These are the people “we know personally, whom we can trust, whom we feel some emotional affinity for.”[5]. And this limit of one hundred and fifty, give or take a few, is imposed by the size of our brains. Dunbar argues we simply don\u0026rsquo;t have the capacity to deal on this intimate face-to-face basis with the thousands with whom we share our lives.\nWe are creatures who were evolved to snuggle and struggle in relatively small social groups. But these days, more often than not, we find ourselves in communities not of tens or hundreds of others, but millions. So how, in these conditions, are we to go on loving and living? This is the question we\u0026rsquo;ll explore next week. We\u0026rsquo;ll be travelling from ancient Athens to the world of Classical Chinese thought to ask about the tension between partial love and impartial justice.\nQuestions Here are some questions to get you thinking about this week\u0026rsquo;s article. Feel free to dive into the comments on the Agora, and let\u0026rsquo;s chat.\nDo you agree that the idea of community is overlooked in our contemporary views of love? What evidence is there for or against this claim? When I first read about the Enxet, I was fascinated by the idea that love involves your wáxok being slightly deflated and soft. What is the relation between love and softness? In what ways might softness be a good thing? And in what ways might it be a bad thing? In this week\u0026rsquo;s piece, I make the case that the Enxet idea of love could be seen as a genuine philosophy of love. Do you agree? In her book All About Love, bell hooks writes that “Communities sustain life—not nuclear families, or the \u0026lsquo;couple,\u0026rsquo; and certainly not the rugged individualist.” Do you agree? Or are there many ways of sustaining life?

            "title": "Alexus McLeod on Maya Philosophy",
            "tags": ["Interviews",],
            "content": "Introduction Alexus McLeod is originally from Washington, DC, and now living in West Hartford, Connecticut. He teaches at the University of Connecticut and writes on a host of topics: Chinese and Mesoamerican Philosophy, mysticism, political history, the history of science (particularly astronomy and medicine), and several other things besides. For much of the past year, like many of us, he has been living the hermit life. Camped out in his home office, he has continued his work exploring the riches of the world\u0026rsquo;s philosophical traditions.\nPart 1: Broadening Out Philosophy Q: Hi, Alexus. It\u0026rsquo;s great to chat with you. The first thing I want to ask is about your astonishingly broad interests. Sometimes I wonder if there’s anything you\u0026rsquo;re not interested in. I know you’ve thought a lot about questions of breadth and depth. So in the face of those who claim academic philosophy must be a business of ever-increasing specialism, I’d be interested to hear your defence of pursuing broad interests.\nI’ve indeed spent a lot of time thinking about these issues. I’ve become increasingly convinced over the years that we need to re-envision the way we think about what philosophy is and can be. The academy is changing, and our place as philosophers is changing within it. Some lament this, but I think on the whole it’s a good thing. The old ways needed shaking up. Now we finally have to confront questions of change, and how we can adapt in ways that benefit us, our institutions, and the broader society, rather than insisting on doing things the “old way” and thus making ourselves irrelevant. The old way involved appalling neglect of entire traditions of thought of large swaths of the world.\nI’m also a methodological pluralist. I think of philosophy as an area in which we should have the room to envision new possibilities, experiment, and continually reimagine what we do. We’re thinking about thinking, about a variety of ways of doing and being. I’ve never been a fan of the view that there’s one particular way philosophy should be done. This seems to me to stifle one of the things that makes philosophy useful and different from other fields. If there is no place for methodological exploration in philosophy, then where is there place for it? Philosophy seems a natural area for such a thing.\nSpecialization can certainly be valuable, and it has brought us great advances in several fields, particularly in the sciences. But this model is not fruitful for every area of intellectual pursuit. Traditionally, philosophy has been the area in which we push the boundaries, consider what is possible, experiment with new ways of thinking about the world. The sciences emerged from philosophy because of this—it was through entertaining new possibilities and trying different things that we discovered powerful new ways of understanding the world. If people in the Middle East and Europe had just stopped back in the Middle Ages and said, “okay, no more methodological divergence—we’re just going to write commentaries on Aristotle making his work useful for Christianity from here on out,” we would not have seen the emergence of the various sciences and fields we see today from this tradition.\nIn a different age, people like Leonardo da Vinci, Aristotle, Ibn Sina, al-Tusi, and Zhang Heng were seen as the ideal scholars. Who had broader interests than they did? And their contributions certainly were not limited by their breadth. So as far as our tendency to focus narrowly today, I think this has to do with both trying to be like fields in the sciences and with our professional focus on “branding”. It’s hard to generate a name for oneself in philosophy (and probably other academic fields) without being the person uniquely associated with some specific area or problem. We’ve followed the same model as branding in entertainment, companies, and other parts of our economy. We’re encouraged to focus our product, and build a brand around that. To work more broadly, we have to break out of this mould.\nBut this is all part of what I mentioned at the start, our need to re-envision what it means to do philosophy professionally. I don’t think that the current model is ultimately working for us. It’s not helping us as thinkers, and it’s also not helping demonstrate our value to (often sceptical) academic institutions. Because at the end of the day, we’re going to have to be able to honestly say something about what we contribute to society and the institutions we’re part of.\nQ: So is there anything you are not interested in?\nNot really! Even when I come across something I’m not initially interested in (which doesn’t happen a lot but does every once in a while), I try to make myself interested in it, and that usually succeeds. The main reason I got into academia in the first place is that I love learning. I enjoy writing, but for me, writing has always been connected to the process of learning things. I never set out to make a big discovery or come up with some new idea that everyone is talking about years down the road. I just really love learning, I get excited about seeing the world in new ways (or new to me at least), and I want to impart something of that enthusiasm to my readers, audiences, students, children, and others I engage with. And I don’t like to stay inside a box with my learning—I want to learn about different people, cultures, parts of the world, whatever.\nThere’s far too much fascinating stuff out here to limit ourselves to one little corner of the world. I like to browse library shelves and select things to read pretty much randomly, and this way I usually find some topic that sparks my interest, and it generates a different project to focus on every couple of years. This way, I can pick out something I’ve been learning about that’s particularly interesting or stayed with me, and develop that further into a writing project. This helps me to make connections I never would have seen otherwise, and to develop ideas I would never have had the ability to develop on my own.\nWe have a tendency in philosophy to view innovation as the realm of the solitary genius in the armchair, but innovation never really works like that. We come up with new things as a result of new experiences and engagement with others. Every intellectual renaissance in history happened after contact with new people and ideas. The greatest genius in the world sitting alone in the armchair is not going to come up with anything but the same old thing over and over again.\nPart 2: Learning from Maya philosophy Q: The title of your book, “Philosophy of the Ancient Maya: Lords of Time” puts the idea of time at the very centre of Maya philosophy. So what are the central preoccupations of Maya philosophy?\nSome of the major issues are time, identity (personal identity and the identity of objects), being and worlds, the human role in shaping the world, change and becoming, government and rulership, and sacrifice. One of the interesting things is that some of these topics may have an outsized influence based on what we know because of the nature of the textual tradition. The vast majority of texts from early Maya sources we have today are from monuments such as stelae and architecture, and these were the texts that tended to commemorate rulers, particular important ritual events and time periods, and important communal events or times.\nWe know that there were also more perishable texts like bark paper books in the pre-Columbian Maya region, but most of these have been lost to the ravages of time. Things like that don’t tend to keep well in the humid rainforest environment of the Maya region. In the sources we have, including several post-contact texts like the K’iche’ Maya Popol Vuh and the Yucatec Chilam Balam books, the concerns are very much with the kinds of philosophical topics I mentioned and with classic issues like truth and the meaning of life. What we find in Maya Philosophy is very much like what we see in other ancient traditions, as far as its breadth—they were very much concerned with the range of philosophical issues. It’s a fascinating tradition.\nQ: You draw a connection between this idea of time and the creative role human beings play in shaping the world. Do you see this emphasis on the human role in ordering time as something of only historical interest? Or do you see it as a philosophical insight with much broader applicability?\nAbsolutely I see it as something with broader applicability! This is a great question, and something I’ve been thinking about quite a bit recently. Actually, one of the first things that really drew me to Maya thought (and Mesoamerican thought more generally) was the strong conception found there of how ritual activity can shape and complete the world and the self (as a component of the world). Even though I read very broadly, I’m generally drawn to spend more time with texts, thinkers, and traditions that I think get things right. I’m an intellectual historian to a certain extent, but also someone who wants to engage with and learn from these traditions. The texts and traditions I work on are ones that I feel hit on important truths that are less prominent or even ignored in our modern discourse (at least in the West).\nWhen I first encountered Maya views of personhood and identity, my thought was “this is not only historically fascinating—I think this is true.” These views, as well as the Maya views of ritual and the human role in the construction of the world (and so many other things as well!), are things we can learn from and adopt. Ritual has an important role to play in organizing our world and structuring the self. We only have a social identity, for example, through the performance of ritual—language, religion, associations, daily activities, characteristic ways of acting, etc.\nSection of a page from the Madrid Codex, which contains instructions for conducting rituals. Reproduced from Contributions to North American ethnology. Vol. I-VII, IX (1877). Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nAccording to the Maya, we can enact identity through ritual. We can literally become someone else, to manifest their essence via substitution (k’ex). This is one of the things I find most compelling and powerful about early Maya views of personhood. We can communicate with our ancestors and with other aspects of the world that constitute us, through ritual performance. If we can enact their characteristic responses, mirror their activities, and occupy their roles, we can literally become them. This is why performance rituals, such as the performance of the activity of the gods recounted in texts like the Popol Vuh, are so important for the Maya. We enact things in the world through performance. The importance of ritual in Maya thought can also help us to reflect on our own regular activities, how these are rituals, and just what we are creating through these actions. I suspect that many of us end up creating much that we don’t want to, just out of the failure to reflect on the rituals we perform and their results.\nQ: In your book, your comparative reference points are in Chinese philosophy rather than in the philosophical traditions that trace their heritage back to Ancient Greece. You talk in the book about “decentring the West”, undermining the assumption that so-called “Western” philosophy should be seen as the yardstick by which all other philosophical traditions are measured. Can you say more about this? And what would a thoroughly decentred philosophy look like?\nThanks for this question—that’s indeed one of the main things I’ve hoped readers would take from this book! One of the things we tend to most often see in comparative philosophy is the presentation of a “local” (generally “non-Western”) tradition paired with the West. This seems to me rooted in the idea that the West is universal in scope, while other traditions are provincial. We often use Western thought as the framework to understand thought anywhere else in the world. Thus, in China you find that it’s common for philosophy departments to include Chinese Philosophy and Western Philosophy, but nothing else. Or departments in India to include Indian and Western Philosophy. Each place respects its own local tradition and then sees the West as the essential other, the means of translation of a local tradition to a more universal form. We see this all the time in the West as well, with how we think about and position non-Western thought. We take Western scholarship or categories as giving us the “natural kinds” through which we then try to understand what is going on in ancient China or India or Mesoamerica. So we ask questions such as “what was the early Maya view of truth?” rather than “what are the Western views of itz?”\nWhen I think about decentring the West, it’s not to somehow denigrate or jettison Western thought. The intellectual heritage of the West is great, but it’s not greater than that of the rest of the world, and shouldn’t be that by which everything else is measured. Decentring the West involves taking concepts from other traditions seriously in our own thinking. Maybe when we think about ethics, for example, we can think in terms of the Chinese concepts of ren and li and not only in terms of virtue and duty. We investigate other traditions in terms of virtue (a classical Greek and Roman concept) all the time. So why can’t we investigate traditions in terms of ren?\nAre the concepts centred in the West truly universal, and those elsewhere only localized copies of those? I don’t think there’s any reason to think this. And a truly global philosophy will look much different—we will have reason to consider things in terms of ren and li and dharma and itz and teotl as much as we do virtue and duty and agency. Much of the reason philosophy seems stuck in certain ways of viewing the world is that we often refuse to learn from other traditions, we refuse to take on the ideas of other traditions as our own in the way we do take on the ideas of the so-called West, and instead we try to understand those traditions by situating them within or reducing them to the categories of the West.\nWhen I was in graduate school, this was all the craze. Reading a text like chapter two of the Zhuangzi, and trying to figure out which kind of more familiar Western theory this represented. Was it scepticism? Conventionalism about language? How did it fit into the categories of contemporary Western philosophy? Certainly we can gain some interesting insights from such projects, and I don’t want to say that doing this kind of thing is fruitless or a waste of time. I’ve read some incredibly good and creative work in this vein. But it seemed to me that very few people, if any, were engaging in different kinds of projects that could help expand our conception of what is philosophically possible, deepen our projects, and contribute to our understanding of the world, rather than a seemingly reductionist project of fitting these into familiar structures.\nQ: At the end of your book, you say that we should engage with Maya thought and modern Maya people, “in the hopes that we may have a true fusion such that one day there will no longer be Maya or Westerners (whatever that means), no longer Chinese, Indians—but a true fusion of all of these groups, such that our descendants can claim the traditions of all of these cultures as their own heritage.” Is there something utopian in this vision of what philosophy could be?\nAbsolutely. I think that’s a good way to put it. What I see as the end goal of all academic endeavours is a future in which humanity works together and sees itself as one family, with a shared sense of its past, present, and purpose, working together in the service of learning about this world we inhabit and about ourselves. I think we should strive to ultimately become more than what we are, to get beyond the provincialism of nation, race, or tradition. Not to erase the past, but to embrace all of it as all of ours, and to use it to create a future in which we create something new out of the best parts of these traditions, rather than just duplicating them as they were and insisting on keeping walls between them to preserve their integrity. This would be like putting a form-fitting iron cage around a child to stop it from growing into an adult.\nI think of myself as an internationalist. I grew up in Washington, D.C., and my friends growing up were from all over the world—the children of diplomats (as is my wife), international businesspeople, and the like. The people around me spoke many different languages and came from many different cultural backgrounds. It always felt to me awkward that, with the world around me so diverse, in the classroom things were so narrow. Was it really only this narrow subset of humanity from Western Europe that created all knowledge, when the other people around me seemed to come from cultural traditions every bit as rich as those of Western Europe? Something was wrong there. When we did learn about traditions outside the West in school, it was always as the “other” rather than our own. It struck me that the traditions of these other parts of the world are as much our own as anything from Western Europe. My ancestors were almost entirely from west and central Africa and the British Isles, not from Greece or France, yet I was taught that Plato and Descartes were “my” tradition, and Confucius, Sankara, or Nezahualcoyotl weren’t. Why?\nThe Acolhua ruler, warrior and philosopher Nezahualcoyotl (1402-1472), ruler of Texcoco, as depicted in the 16th century Codex Ixtlilxochitl. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nAfter years of studying these and other thinkers on my own (as they were neglected in my philosophical training), I realized that not only do they offer essential truths, but they can be seen as part of our shared human tradition as much as Plato or any other influential thinker. There is no reason Confucius, for example, has to be an “other” or someone representing a “different” tradition any more than Kant or Mill or whoever. Personally, I’ve been far more influenced by the thought of Confucius than I have by that of Plato or Kant. Does that make Confucius a more central part of my tradition than those European figures? It just feels bizarre as well as false to refer to Kant as part of “my” tradition while referring to Confucius as part of “other” traditions. And this othering of the so-called “non-West” closes the door on the possibility of those of us in the West learning from and adopting views from these great thinkers as our own, allowing them to shape us. What makes a tradition is what one reads, engages with, responds to, takes seriously. So there’s no reason that we can’t or shouldn’t create an intellectual tradition that includes the thought of the entire world, which we now have unprecedented access to in our globally connected age. The texts of the ancients are part of our shared human tradition. I hope for a day when we all feel completely at ease referring to the traditions of Mesoamerica, China, Europe, Africa, and everywhere else as “our” traditions rather than “theirs”.\nPart 3: Doing something new Q: So what’s next on the horizon for you and your work?\nI’ve got a few different projects bouncing around at different stages of development. Most recently, I’ve started working on a new translation and commentary on the K’iche’ Maya text Popol Vuh and the early Chinese text Daodejing. I’m also finishing an Introduction to Mesoamerican Philosophy due to appear in the Cambridge Introductions to Philosophy series, working on a translation (with Yuhan Liang) of the Han Dynasty Confucian text Kongzi Jiayu (“Discourses of the Confucius School”), and thinking about a new history of Han Dynasty Philosophy that I’ve wanted to write for a while. I just finished a long entry for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy on Han philosophy, and this rekindled my interest in tackling the book project, as there is a lot I wanted to include in that entry but didn’t have the space. Always juggling lots of projects—and I’m sure a few more will pop up in the near future!\nQ: And finally, if you could give any advice to an aspiring philosopher, what would it be?\nTalking to my own students and others, I find that many aspiring philosophers want very much the same kind of thing I wanted when I decided to pursue philosophy as a career—the space to learn new things, and to work on interesting things that you think really matter (to you and your community). There can be quite a bit of pressure against doing that in professional philosophy. There’s pressure to be ultra-narrow, to work on certain hot topics that people in certain specific circles care about, and not to work on things that people in those circles don’t care about or reject. Pressure to set aside the things you might be more interested in and that really motivate you, to adhere to the standards set by the people in these circles, because of the idea that the only place really worth being is in those circles or adjacent to them. My advice is: don’t sacrifice what you want to do for what you think you’re supposed to do. Nobody will change the field if not us, and none of us makes enough money to justify setting aside what we really want in order to fit in, get a job, etc.\nBecause that game never ends—there’s always a new pressure to do that thing others want you to do but you don’t. It doesn’t end once you get that job, once you get tenure, once you get promotion. That thing you always really wanted to do gets saved until after the dissertation, then after tenure, then after promotion, retirement, and it never happens at all. Remember why you wanted to be a philosopher. Do it now. Be bold now. Don’t let anyone tell you that you need to wait or compromise on what you’re trying to do for some goal down the line. Once you compromise like that, you’ll just keep on compromising all the way down the line. This is how we all get stuck in patterns none of us actually like, but find it increasingly hard to break free of. This might sound like trite “follow your dreams” advice, but I think people really need to hear it. I can’t tell you how often I hear from younger or aspiring scholars who really want things in our field to be different but are just afraid to cut against that grain or feel like they can’t, which is totally understandable. But there are far more of us out here who support what they’re trying to do than they may think. We’re the only ones we’ve got. We don’t have to do things a certain way just because they were done that way before—so let’s change them! As I mentioned above, this is the time for a change anyway. Academia is undergoing massive (and not always comfortable) changes—let’s use this change to take this field where we want it to go. Use the crisis to dislodge an orthodoxy that should have been toppled long ago but held on for so long simply because it was never forced to change.\nSpeaking for myself as someone who regularly sees and evaluates job candidates (across the numerous institutions I’ve worked for)—the people who’ve always most impressed me and who I want most to work with aren’t necessarily those who work in my area or whose views I agree with. I want to see the people who are taking chances, who are working on those things they’re really committed to, whether “off the wall” or not. Who are pushing boundaries, rethinking what it means to be a philosopher, bringing new voices into the field. Those voices don’t have to be like mine—although if your voice sounds like mine, that’s cool too. Senior scholars shouldn’t be in the business of duplicating ourselves (though sadly, we are sometimes), but rather should be trying to help others find their own voices. Find your voice, whatever that is—that’s what I want to hear, and that’s what we need to hear.\nLet’s do something new.\nBrief bio Alexus McLeod is Associate Professor of Philosophy and Asian/Asian-American Studies at the University of Connecticut.

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "Welcome to our Season Two Looking for Wisdom Course Birds do it. Bees do it. And according to Cole Porter, even educated fleas do it (although I\u0026rsquo;m not quite so sure). But what is this thing called love? What does it mean to fall in love? And why does love loom so large in our individual and collective lives?\nWelcome to season two in our Looking for Wisdom course series, where we\u0026rsquo;re going to be exploring the philosophy of love. Over the coming seven weeks, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be trying to make some sense of what is one of our deepest—and often most confusing—human preoccupations.\nLove songs Human beings have always been obsessed with love. One indication of the depth of this obsession is in the number of songs that testify to the varieties of human love. Love songs seem almost universal. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example from ancient Sumer, around 4000 years ago, written by a woman to her lover:\nMan, I will ply you with charm. My treasure, I will bring you honey, in the bedroom oozing honey. Let us enjoy your charm. Darling, I will ply you with charm. My treasure, I will bring you honey.[1]\nOver in China, the Shi Jing or Book of Songs contains many songs about love, lust, and everything in between. One example is this song about a lover who has a date with a certain Zhongzi, who seems determined to lustily vault over the fence into the lover\u0026rsquo;s garden, even at the risk of causing trouble.\nPlease, Zhongzi, Don’t climb into our garden, Don’t break the spindle trees we have planted. Not that I am concerned with them, I am afraid of what people say. I love you, Zhongzi, But I am afraid Of what people will say. [2]\nAnd one of my favourites is this entertaining gem from India, in the anthology of love songs called the Gāhā Sattasaī. In this song, a woman is dousing the flames as her house burns; but the kindling of the flames of love gives her hope not all is lost:\nEven though everything I had went up in flames I am overjoyed, For during the fire It was he who took the bucket of water From my hand into his. [3]\nAnd a couple of thousand years later, we\u0026rsquo;re still at it. Things fall apart, Miley Cyrus reminds us. And nothing breaks like a heart. Throughout human history, the sheer amount of energy that has been put into falling in love, falling out of love, renouncing love, embracing love, arguing about love, worrying about love, thinking about love, writing about love and singing about love is staggering.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something going on here, something that is ripe for philosophical discussion. But what?\nTwo Hearts that Beat as One, Sung With Great Success by Jolly Mae La Reno (1901). Public domain via New York Public Library.\nBiological machines and social roles One thing that makes love hard to pin down is that although love seems to be a human universal, it looks very different in different contexts.\nIn her book What Love is, and What it Could Be, philosopher Carrie Jenkins writes that love is “ancient biological machinery embodying a modern social role” [4]. When we fall in love, there is real biological stuff going on. And if we (and the birds and the bees and the educated fleas) all do it, the reasons for this are rooted in our biology and our evolutionary history. We get turned on. We lust. We desire. We navigate complex webs of trust and affection. Irreducibly social animals, we snuggle and cuddle and seek the company of others whom we like. This is what we were made for.\nBecause of this shared biological heritage, we feel we can understand when a singer in ancient Sumer sings about being in the bedroom oozing honey. We get what is going on when the lusty Zhongzi tries to vault over the fence. We smile, as the ancient Indian poet may have smiled, at the image of the woman dousing the flames as her house burns, and finding her heart leap in her chest as she is passed a bucket of water by the object of her affections.\nBut love in is not straightforwardly biological. Although we get the Indian love song, we perhaps don\u0026rsquo;t get it in quite the same way an Indian reader might. The meanings we give fire are not quite the same that the ancient Indian poet gave them. And the meanings we give love are not the same either. So alongside all our biological commonalities, if we want to make sense of human ideas of love, we need to take account of human malleability. The forms love takes, the meanings we give it, the ways in which we understand it, are all fashioned by the cultures of which we are a part. Love is culture and biology.\nOf course, this combination of ancient biological machinery and modern social roles is not unique to love. It is an instance of a broader anthropological truth about the way biology and culture intersect. Many aspects of human life—justice, friendship, family—can only be understood if we take account of both social and cultural roles and our underlying biological machinery. And this is one reason why, in our search for philosophical understanding, it pays to take a broader perspective, rather than relying on the insights of one culture or one tradition.\nThis is certainly the case when it comes to love. Philosophical discussions of love are often rooted in Greek and European traditions. But they tend to pay less attention to traditions from elsewhere. So in this course, I want to try something different. In our quest for understanding what love is, we\u0026rsquo;ll be going further afield. We\u0026rsquo;ll be exploring notions of love in Greece and India, in the philosophical cultures of sub-Saharan Africa, and in the rainforest cultures of Amazonia. Because only when we see how the same biological themes are transformed by endlessly inventive cultural variations, can we start to understand the complex territories of human love.\nMessy love, and philosophical housekeeping A Philosopher Engaged in a bit of Housekeeping. From France in the XXI century (1899), Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something messy about love. And the messiness is part of the reason for our fascination. Love is hard to pin down, hard to get a handle on. Human love seems such a slippery kind of thing that it gives rise to endless confusion and uncertainty.\nFor some philosophers—those for whom the primary task of philosophy is clearing up conceptual confusion—the temptation when confronted by this kind of mess is to come bustling in with brushes and brooms to start tidying things up. And this might seem at first glance to be a good thing. Who likes undue confusion? But if you want to understand the mess of human life, you admit the philosophers into your house at your peril. Once they have tidied things away, moved around the furniture, and conjured ingeniously rational systems for filing all those bits and pieces that you have lying around, things may certainly seem tidier. Everything may look sparkling and new, the lines of argument clear. But once the philosophers have done their work, it can sometimes also be hard not to feel slightly less at home. Philosophical accounts of human existence can be like those idealized show-homes you sometimes see: well-tended, meticulously thought-out, but ultimately not very liveable. And when it comes to philosophical accounts of love, if there is too much clearing away of the everyday human mess, along the way it is hard not to feel that something has been lost.\nLiving with (a modicum of) mess This is not to say that we should give up on the task of clearing up conceptual confusion. When engaging in philosophical housekeeping, it can be good to put things in order. We can\u0026rsquo;t live in the middle of absolute conceptual chaos. But philosophy isn\u0026rsquo;t just about clearing up confusion. It is also be about something close to its opposite. It is about awakening us to new kinds of perplexity, precisely when we thought everything was tidily nailed-down.\nSometimes, philosophy can help us clear up the questions that bother us. But at other times, it can help us deepen these questions, disrupting our tidy everyday assumptions, and sowing perplexity and confusion where once we imagined everything was in order.\nIf we want to live and love and thrive, both these approaches are needed. We cannot live well when everything is simply chaos and confusion. But we cannot live well if we shoehorn the disorderliness of human life into too narrow a conceptual framework. Sometimes, when things are looking just too tidy, it\u0026rsquo;s necessary to mess them up a bit. Or at least to acknowledge that mess is inevitable.\nSo by the end of this course, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect to have the answers to the Great Questions about love. After seven weeks of exploring philosophical ideas of love, we\u0026rsquo;re not going to be able to rest easy, with “love” filed away tidily on the shelf.\nBy the end of this course, you may have some partial answers to at least some of the questions you have about love. But you may equally find that these questions have just become deeper, more perplexing and more puzzling. Either way, I hope that a bit more philosophical nuance, and a broader idea of what is at stake, will help you better navigate the challenges and the puzzles of human life and love.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in this course? Over the coming seven weeks, we\u0026rsquo;ll be roaming from Ancient Greece, China, and India to the rich philosophical traditions of sub-Saharan Africa and the rainforests of Amazonia, taking a global perspective on how and why we love.\nWeek 1: “Let\u0026rsquo;s Do It.” The philosophy of love In week one, we look at love songs, the universality of human love, the intersection of biology and culture and some questions about philosophical housekeeping. Week 2: “We All Stand Together.” Love, connection and community In week two, we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at philosophical ideas about love, connection, and community. Love is inherently social. So what does it mean to be a social being who loves and hates, snuggles and struggles. Week 3: “Something so Right.” Love and justice You come home one day to find your beloved planning a raid on the local bank. Do you choose justice and hand them over to the care of the police? Or do you choose love, and help them achieve their goals? Week 4: “You Sexy Thing.” Getting philosophical about sex When Cole Porter sings about what birds, bees and educated fleas get up to, we all know he\u0026rsquo;s not just talking about love: he\u0026rsquo;s talking about sex. In week three, we\u0026rsquo;ll be getting philosophical about sex. Week 5: “Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong.” Love, transcendence and madness Love is sometimes said to be something that has the power to transports us to a different way of being. But does love really lift us up where we belong? Does it make us whole? Or is it even a kind of madness? Week 6: “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?” Love, uncertainty and the future Love often seems be about our ideas of the future, and how we make sense of living in a world where the future is uncertain. So this week, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how love, trust, and our hopes and fears for the future are tangled up together. Week 7: “Wise men say only fools rush in.” Love and wisdom In the final week, we\u0026rsquo;ll talk about philosophy, or the “love of wisdom”. Is wisdom really that loveable? And is there a deeper philosophical relationship between wisdom and love? Questions Here are some questions to get you thinking about these ideas. If you are a member, dive into the comments on the Agora, and let\u0026rsquo;s chat.\nIf you were put on the spot and asked for a provisional definition of love, how would you define it? If love involves both biological machinery and culture, how do we distinguish between what is cultural and what is biological? How is it possible to draw a clear line? Is love really so different in different cultural contexts? Can you think of any examples (either from history, or from your own experience)? In this piece, I suggest that love is inherently messy and confusing. But is it? Or, if we are philosophical enough, is there a chance that we can sort out the mess and the confusion?

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Sunzi’s “The Art of War” is an ancient Chinese text that has become famous worldwide for its insights into strategy. But scratch the surface, and you find a text that is as troubling as it is fascinating.\nIf you are a business leader wanting to inject some gravitas and swagger into your PowerPoint presentation, then Sunzi’s The Art of War is the way to go. This ancient Chinese classic is often cited in the business world, at boardrooms and at training events. It is used by sports trainers seeking to inspire their players. And it is an inspiration for military leaders, who praise it as the go-to text for insights into military strategy. So who was this ancient philosopher? And why does his book still have such an influence down to the present day?\nThe traditional biographies say that the military strategist Sunzi, whose given name was Sun Wu, was born in the state of Qi sometime around 544 BCE. This would make him a contemporary of Confucius, and an heir of Guan Zhong, who died a century before. However, the book that is named after Sunzi, Sunzi\u0026rsquo;s Art of War (Sunzi bingfa) clearly shows the hand of multiple authors, and it probably dates to the latter half of the Warring States period (475 BCE - 221 BCE).\nFrom at least as early as the Song dynasty in the twelfth century, there has been doubt about whether Sunzi was a historical figure at all. The contemporary scholar Victor Mair concludes that Sunzi is, \u0026ldquo;a purely legendary figure concerning whom not a shred of reliable biographical data exists.\u0026rdquo; But he then adds that \u0026ldquo;for those who believe in him, he is as real as any deity or mythical hero.\u0026rdquo;\nMurder on the drill-ground It is certainly true that the only accounts that have come down to us of Sunzi\u0026rsquo;s life are fanciful at best. In one story related in the bamboo texts excavated at Yinque Shan (or Silver Sparrow Mountain) in China in 1972, Sunzi is appointed as a minister to the court of king Helü of Wu. During an audience with the king, the ruler talks to Sunzi about his fondness for war. Sunzi responds as follows:\nUsing the military is to gain the advantage; it is not a matter of being fond of it\u0026hellip; it is not a matter of sport. If Your Majesty wants to ask about war in terms of fondness and sport, I dare not reply\u0026hellip;Sun-Tzu: The Art of Warfare, translated Roger T. Ames, p. 85\nFor Sunzi, warfare is not a game. It is about getting results. But the king will not listen to him. And what happens next is horrific. In the version of the story told by Sima Qian (145 BCE - c. 86 BCE), Helü of Wu can\u0026rsquo;t get it out of his head that warfare is just a bit of a lark. He is interested only in entertainment. And so, because he is looking for a bit of a diversion, the king assembles a group of one hundred and eighty women from the court, and he tells Sunzi to train them in military strategy.\nSunzi puts two of the king\u0026rsquo;s most favoured court women in charge as commanders. King Helü still thinks it is all a huge joke. He watches from the balcony as the women go through the military manoeuvres. But then things take a horrible turn. Taking their cues from the king, the women do not take the drilling seriously. They keep falling about laughing. Sunzi\u0026rsquo;s response is brutal. He orders that the two women who have been placed in command should be beheaded.\nAfter this, a chill descends over the drill-ground. And the palace women are soon assembled into a formidably disciplined force.\nAppointing the next two in line as the new unit commanders, he again drilled them. Left, right, front, back, kneel, stand—at every turn the women performed with the precision of the square and compass, and did not dare to utter a sound. Master Sun thereupon sent a messenger to report to the King, “The troops have now been properly disciplined. Your Majesty can come down to inspect them. Do as you like with them—you can even send them through fire and water!”Sun-Tzu: The Art of Warfare, translated Roger T. Ames, p. 17\nThese are parts of Sunzi\u0026rsquo;s story that don\u0026rsquo;t usually make it into the self-help books, or into the PowerPoints of business leaders.\nPhilosophy Five criteria The Art of War begins with the claim that the \u0026ldquo;vital matter of state\u0026rdquo; that is warfare cannot be left unexamined. The unexamined war is not worth waging. So the book goes on to set out the principles of waging successful war.\nThe Art of War sets out five criteria that can guarantee success or failure in war: the dao or the way (here not a metaphysical notion, but instead the underlying ethos that binds an army together into a unity); the climate; the terrain; the quality of command; and finally fa — order and discipline (see the Philosopher File on fa in Guan Zhong\u0026rsquo;s philosophy).\nTo wage a successful campaign is not really about military hardware. Instead, it is about strategy, about attention to external conditions, about having the correct bureaucratic chains of command in place, and about having a system of discipline and punishment that can make sure these chains remain unbroken.\nThe fruits of deceit It is at this point that the Art of War makes an interesting turn. Warfare, the author says, is the \u0026ldquo;way of deceit.\u0026rdquo; And the book goes on to set out an argument for instrumental low cunning that has guaranteed its fame and notoriety down to the present.\nAccording to this \u0026ldquo;way of deceit\u0026rdquo;, if you are competent, you should give the appearance of being incompetent. If you are active, you should give the appearance of passivity. If you are close by, you should let others believe you are far away (and vice versa). This is how to wrong-foot your opponent.\nIn this view, success in warfare does not depend on adherence to a constant set of rules. Instead, what matters most is our responsiveness to the conditions and the tendencies of the time (the term in Chinese is shi 勢), so that we can take maximum strategic advantage, by whatever means necessary.\nTherefore, when able, seem to be unable; when ready, seem unready; when nearby, seem far away; and when far away, seem near. If the enemy seeks some advantage, entice him with it. If he is in disorder, attack him and take him. If he is formidable, prepare against him. If he is strong, evade him. If he is incensed, provoke him. If he is humble, encourage his arrogance. If he is rested, wear him down. If he is internally harmonious, sow divisiveness in his ranks. Attack where he is not prepared; go by way of places where it would never occur to him you would goSun-Tzu: The Art of Warfare, translated Roger T. Ames, p. 41\nIn line with these principles, the Art of War explores questions such as when to attack, when to fall on the defensive, the virtues of using spies, and above all, the role of timing in military strategy.\nHow to lose friends and influence people What makes the Art of War so disturbing and fascinating is its focus on how to prevail at any cost. There is no room here for the rules of war, or for notions of \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; war. What matters is not morality, but advantage. This means that seeking wisdom in the Art of War may not win you many friends. But then, strategy is not about winning friends. It is about winning the war so you can extend your range of influence.\nNevertheless, there is a kind of ethics built in to the Art of War, one that lies in the recognition that war is a serious business. War is not about sport or fun. It is not about the posturing of rulers or their attempts at winning personal glory. Nor is it about honour and virtue and all the other myths that can often sustain and perpetuate human conflicts. What matters instead is simply getting the horrible job of war done as quickly and as decisively as possible.\nIn the later Chinese tradition, the Art of War was controversial. Confucians objected to its disregard for moral rectitude. But it remains a book that is widely read in military and business circles. And for those who may find the book problematic, given its influence, it is worth reading. After all, as the author of the Art of War himself might counsel, it is important to know what your enemy is up to. Particularly if what they are up to is reading the Art of War.\nFurther Reading Books Victor Mair\u0026rsquo;s translation (Columbia University Press 2007) is hugely accessible.

            "content": "Three radical women philosophers from the ancient world Although it is sometimes said that the history of philosophy is the history of human attempts to understand ourselves and the world, if you pick up any introductory philosophy textbook, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take long to realise this isn\u0026rsquo;t quite true. Philosophy may claim to talk about human universals, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to sustain this claim when most of the named figures in the historical traditions of the world are men: the history of philosophy is also the history of the exclusion of women\u0026rsquo;s voices from these conversations about what it means to be human. As Rebecca Buxton and Lisa Whiting write in their book The Philosopher Queens, \u0026ldquo;The history of philosophy has not done women justice.\u0026quot;[1]\nThis exclusion of women\u0026rsquo;s voices not only makes the history of philosophy considerably more boring than it otherwise would be. It also undermines the universality of philosophy\u0026rsquo;s claims. Do the world\u0026rsquo;s philosophical traditions really succeed in getting to grips with what it means to be human? Or are they just a testament to how men have grappled with the questions that most preoccupy them as men?\nSo if we want to reimagine what philosophy is, or what it could be, a good starting point is taking more seriously those women philosophers who have attempted to disrupt the assumptions built into the traditions of philosophy we have inherited.\nSince the ancient world, women thinkers have mounted border-raids on the heartlands of philosophy, and have pushed back against the assumptions of their male contemporaries. The following three stories are about women thinkers who have pushed back against in this way. All three of these women philosophers resist the idea that men are the only ones who are capable of engaging in philosophy, politics or public life. All three of them subvert the view that women\u0026rsquo;s domain is strictly domestic. And all three raise questions about the art traditionally associated with women in their societies: the art of weaving. In doing so, they weave arguments of their own that unsettle the philosophical complacency of their male contemporaries.\nWeaving the world with Gārgī Vācaknavī Gārgī Vācaknavī is one of the earliest named women philosophers in the Indian tradition. She is said to have lived sometime around 700 BCE, and she appears in the ancient Indian text, the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, where she holds her own in a philosophical debate with the sage Yājñavalkya.\nThe Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad tells the story of a debating contest held by King Janaka of Videha. The cocky Yājñavalkya is convinced he is going to win the contest. But he hasn\u0026rsquo;t accounted for the subtlety of Gārgī. When it is her turn to speak, she starts by asking Yājñavalkya an unsettling philosophical question: what is the world woven on? In asking her question, Gārgī draws upon metaphors of weaving, a skill traditionally associated with women. And perhaps Yājñavalkya already feels he is not quite on solid ground. It is as if Gārgī knows that she\u0026rsquo;s wrong-footing him, that when it comes to weaving, Yājñavalkya is not quite as sure of himself as he otherwise might be.\nThis is how the debate begins:\nThen Gārgī Vācaknavī began to question him.\u0026ldquo;Yājñavalkya,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;tell me—since this whole world is woven back and forth on water, on what, then, is water woven back and forth?\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;On air, Gārgī.\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;On what, then, is air woven back and forth?\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;On the worlds of the intermediate region, Gārgī.\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;On what, then, are the worlds of the intermediate region woven back and forth?\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad 3.6.1. [2]\nWith every answer Yājñavalkya gives, Gārgī pushes the question still further: \u0026ldquo;Yes, but what is that __ woven on\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; And as the debate goes on, it\u0026rsquo;s clear that Yājñavalkya is out of his depth. Soon, it starts to look like he is making it up as he goes along. And then, after several more questions, Yājñavalkya has finally had enough. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t ask too many questions, Gārgī,\u0026rdquo; he says, \u0026ldquo;or your head will shatter apart!\u0026rdquo;\nIt is hardly a knock-down philosophical argument. Gārgī decides it is wiser to push her questions no further, and she falls silent. But it clear who the winner is in this debate (you can read more about the debate here).\nWeaving politics with Jing Jiang A century and a half later, over in China, another woman philosopher drew on her expertise in weaving to fashion arguments of her own. Jing Jiang was born sometime around 540 BCE in the state of Lu. Her story appears in the Discourses of the States (Guoyu), which dates to around the fourth century BCE, and in the later Lienü zhuan, or Biographies of Exemplary Women. Traditional accounts say she was praised by Confucius for her knowledge of ritual and social conduct.\nBut as the scholar Lisa Raphals has argued, Jing Jiang\u0026rsquo;s ability as a philosopher went a lot further than this.[3] In the Biographies of Exemplary Women, we find her instructing her wayward son Gongfu Wenbo in the art of politics. Wenbo seems to be a somewhat hapless individual. When he becomes a minister in the state of Lu, he makes a hash of it, so his mother decides to intervene. But she cannot intervene directly. In Ancient China, women were denied access to the male-dominated realms of politics and philosophy, and their views were not granted any authority. This presents Jing Jiang with a problem: how to persuade her son that her words have weight when women\u0026rsquo;s voices are liable to be dismissed?\nThe account in the Biographies of Exemplary Women tells the story like this.\nWhen Wenbo served as minister in Lu, Jing Jiang told him, “I will tell you how the essentials of ruling a country can be found in [the art of weaving]: everything depends upon the warp! The selvage is the means by which the crooked is made straight. It must be strong. The selvage can therefore be thought of as the general. The reed is the means by which one makes uniform what is irregular and brings into line the unruly. Therefore the reed can be thought of as the director [\u0026hellip;]\u0026quot;— Biographies of Exemplary Women [4]\nRaphals highlights the subtlety of Jing Jiang\u0026rsquo;s approach. First, she gets her son to agree to the analogy between statecraft and weaving (an analogy, incidentally, that Plato also makes in his dialogue The Statesman). Once she has done this, she has gained the authority to speak. Now Wenbo has accepted her analogy, Jing Jiang is free to talk about politics and statecraft (a domain where it is assumed she has no authority) by drawing parallels with weaving (a domain where she has absolute authority). So as she weaves her argument, talking about the mysteries of the loom, she demonstrates to Wenbo that, contrary to the expectations of her time, when it comes to politics, she is both astute and knowledgable. At the end of her discourse, Wenbo is convinced. The text tells us that \u0026ldquo;Wenbo bowed twice and received her teaching.\u0026rdquo;\nWeaving new arguments with Hipparchia The third story comes from the ancient Greek world and concerns Hipparchia, one of the most fascinating women philosophers in the Greek tradition. Born in Thrace, two centuries after Jing Jiang, Hipparchia came from a privileged background. When she was still a teenager her family moved to the city of Athens, where she fell in with the Cynic philosopher Crates. The Cynic philosophers were fiercely critical of social norms. They cultivated what they called anaideia or \u0026ldquo;shamelessness\u0026rdquo;, and often embraced homelessness and a life of wandering in their quest for a way of living that was in accord with nature.\nAlthough Crates was much older than her, against the wishes of Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s parents, the two philosophers got married. After their marriage, they became a well-known philosophical double-act on the Athenian scene. On one occasion, according to the later writer Diogenes Laërtius, they both turned up at a symposium or philosophical drinking party. In ancient Athens, this was nothing short of a scandal. Symposia were exclusive men\u0026rsquo;s clubs. Women might be in attendance as musicians, entertainers or sex workers; but they could not participate as equals.\nThe male philosophers were horrified by Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s attendance. The philosopher Theodoros was particularly outraged. He directly challenged Hipparchia\u0026rsquo;s right to be there. Hipparchia replied by saying that if something was permissible for Theodoros, then it should be permissible for Hipparchia. Having made her point, she moved on to crack a joke. It is of course permissible, she said, that Theodoros should punch himself. And if what is permissible for Theodoros is also permissible for Hipparchia, then, she said, it follows that it should be okay for her to punch him too.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know if Hipparchia actually threw the punch. But in the fracas that ensued, Theodoros tried to strip her of her robe. Hipparchia rose above it all. She was, after all, a philosopher who embraced shamelessness, and it was all the same to her whether she wore a robe or not. So when Theodoros attempted to remove her robe, she was \u0026ldquo;neither alarmed nor perturbed by that, as one might expect a woman to be.\u0026quot;[5]\nSeeing that he could not outdo Hipparchia, Theodoros quoted a line of ancient poetry from the playwright Euripides. Who was she, he asked, to abandon her loom and intrude on this men\u0026rsquo;s world? Hipparchia (readjusting her robe, we can imagine) said that she had no regrets about abandoning the loom because in doing so, she had been able to dedicate herself to the pursuit of learning and philosophy.\nWeaving resistance These three tales about weaving and philosophy from different parts of the ancient world are a testament to the creativity women philosophers have used to regain and assert authority where authority has been denied them.\nIn India, Gārgī Vācaknavī uses metaphors drawn from weaving to wrong-foot her opponent and to ask subtle questions about the fundamental nature of the universe.\nIn China, Jing Jiang uses her knowledge of weaving and the power of analogy to demonstrate her skill in argument and her knowledge in the realm of politics—both things denied to her as a woman.\nMeanwhile, in Ancient Greece, when Theodoros runs out of arguments against Hipparchia and tells her to go back to her loom, she refuses the idea outright. Because Hipparchia knows what Theodoros doesn\u0026rsquo;t: that if philosophy—the love of wisdom—is to mean anything at all, it needs to embrace the whole range of human experience.\nNotes [1] Rebecca Buxton and Lisa Whiting, The Philosopher Queens (Unbound 2020), p. 7.\n[2] Patrick Olivelle (translator), The Early Upaniṣads (Oxford University Press 1998), p. 85.\n[3] Lisa Raphals, \u0026ldquo;Arguments by Women in Early Chinese Texts\u0026rdquo;, Nan Nü 3.2 (2001), pp. 157-195.\n[4] Anne Behnke Kinney (translator), Exemplary women of early China: the Lienü zhuan of Liu Xiang ( Columbia University Press 2014), p. 13.

            "content": "Welcome to the final piece in this short series on wisdom. Over this series, we\u0026rsquo;ve explored a rich range of traditions to try and get a handle on what wisdom is (if it is anything at all), how it matters (if it matters), and how to cultivate it (if it is the kind of thing you can cultivate).\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve covered a lot of ground over the past few articles. So in this piece, we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a quick tour of the territory we have explored. And then we\u0026rsquo;re going to come right up to date by asking about what contemporary science has to say about wisdom.\nFor some scientists, although wisdom was once the domain of philosophy and religion, it is now increasingly something that we can understand scientifically. This being the case, they argue, we no longer have any need of philosophy. But is this true? And is wisdom so easily tamed?\nOn the way to wisdom But before we talk about all this, let\u0026rsquo;s go back to the beginning. In the first article in this series, we started out by asking what wisdom is. Drawing on a range of philosophical approaches, we saw that wisdom involves a combination of clear-sightedness, skill in navigating the world, the ability to effectively manage our lives, and the ability to communicate all this to others.\nWe also saw how, although wisdom might seem an elevated goal, it is also often quite ordinary. Wisdom isn\u0026rsquo;t just about abstruse theories. It is also about how we go about our lives. However clever somebody might be, if they spend their practical lives getting into all kinds of scrapes, it\u0026rsquo;s not clear we could call them wise. So in the second piece, we looked at Aristotle, and the distinction he makes between phronesis (practical wisdom, or wisdom associated with praxis) and theoria (theoretical wisdom).\nWhat makes Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s account challenging is that he upends many of our assumptions about the relationship between theory and practice. For him, practical wisdom can never be simply about applying theory to specific circumstances. Instead, Aristotle insists that practical wisdom is a wholly different kind of thing from theoretical wisdom. In practical wisdom, he argues, the specific circumstances always have a greater weight than any general rules. This makes practical wisdom a kind of navigational skill (as we saw in the story of our two seafarers in the second piece).\nThis goes against present-day intuitions. We tend to think that theory is validated by how useful it is. Only when we can find a theory\u0026rsquo;s practical application does it justify us going to the trouble of developing theoretical wisdom in the first place. But Aristotle disagrees. For him, things are the other way round. It is not the job of theory to inform practice. Instead, it is the job of practice to build a foundation of wise action, which is a necessary condition for us to build a life dedicated to theoretical contemplation.\nIn the third piece, we looked at the limits of wisdom. What if the wisdom we hope for, or to which we aspire, is forever out of reach? There\u0026rsquo;s a strong precedent for this thought. The wisdom of Socrates consisted in knowing how much he didn\u0026rsquo;t know. And the Zhuangzi is sceptical about the very idea of the pursuit of knowledge and virtue. For the Zhuangzi, the quest for wisdom is a kind of wild goose chase, as we try to cram an infinity of things we could know into the finite vessel of our minds. And the pursuit of virtue, or practical wisdom, is similarly problematic: after all, the Zhuangzi asks, what if our pursuit of virtue simply screws things up?\nAn Owl Disguised as a Pilgrim. 1500s. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nIn the fourth article, we looked at an ambiguity that has existed in the European philosophical tradition since Greek times. According to Plato, Socrates argued that wisdom was a matter of leaving behind, as far as possible, our concern with the body. Wisdom is about accessing the pure realms of thought, far from the mess of our bodily lives. But Xenophon\u0026rsquo;s account of Socrates gives a very different view. For Xenophon, Socrates argued that the body had a crucial role in wisdom, even if we understand wisdom in the most refined and theoretical sense. We all know that we can\u0026rsquo;t think clearly if we have a fever, if we are drunk, if we are tired, or if we are in physical distress.\nPractical wisdom is about action, so it necessarily depends on the body. But theory or contemplation involves the body too, simply because there is always a physical, embodied person who is doing the contemplating. Here Aristotle seems close to the mark when he says that developing practical wisdom (which involves action, and so also involves the body) is a precondition for contemplation. Despite the views that Plato attributes to Socrates, this all suggests the body has a huge role to play in the pursuit of wisdom. The search for better, wiser ways of living necessarily involves, to use a term from contemporary philosopher Richard Shusterman, somaesethetics: the attention to and the use of the body in particular ways.\nIn week five, we returned to Aristotle to ask about the role of virtue in human flourishing. We also looked at Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s Chinese contemporary Mencius, or Mengzi, who had a clear-eyed appreciation of how flourishing is not just individual, but also social and political. If we care about flourishing, we need to put in place the conditions so that we can collectively flourish. We need to ask not only how we ourselves can become wise and virtuous, but also how we can build a wiser, more virtuous social order.\nThen in week six, we circled back to the question of wisdom and its limits to ask about whether wisdom\u0026rsquo;s apparent opposite—foolishness—might harbour some kind of strange wisdom of its own. We looked at the idea of the wise fool who carries a lamp through the streets in daylight, and traced this idea all the way from Diogenes to Rumi. We asked whether wisdom is always doomed to be *atopos—*at odds with the world. And finally, we explored the idea of moral foolishness. Because perhaps the wisest course of action is to make peace with our foolishness, giving up on our pursuit of wisdom and virtue. This is a view that is suggested by the Zhuangzi, with its pungent criticisms of the harms caused by the Confucians as they strain after goodness.\nA Confucian Scholar (Fu Sheng), painted by Du Jin. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nA science of wisdom? For anybody who cares about attaining some measure of wisdom, there might be something depressing in this riot of dissenting philosophical views. The philosophers seem to have a lot to say, but they also don\u0026rsquo;t seem to agree on much. This being the case, it is not surprising that over the past half century, scientists have started to turn their attention to wisdom, to try and clear up some of the mess left by the philosophers.\nThe earliest glimmerings of what is now often called \u0026ldquo;the science of wisdom\u0026rdquo; can be traced by to the 1950s, when the psychologist Erik Erikson proposed that wisdom could be seen as the final and culminating stage in human development. Erikson\u0026rsquo;s work was taken up by Vivian Clayton, who wrote her doctoral dissertation in 1976 on the empirical study of wisdom. At the end of the dissertation, Clayton set out a clear vision of how science might come to save us from the confusions of the philosophers:\nWisdom has had meaning and relevance in religious and philosophical circles for centuries. It is hoped that this study will be the first of many that elevate the concept of wisdom to scientific status and usefulness.[1]\nBut it has taken the best part of five decades to put the scientific study of wisdom on a firmer footing. Part of the problem is that despite a proliferation of research that claims to be working on the science of wisdom, a consensus about what wisdom is has only emerged very slowly. Nevertheless, according to Igor Grossmann from the Wisdom and Culture lab at the university of Waterloo in Canada, this is beginning to change. In 2019, Grossmann gathered together a motley collection of scientists working on the topic of wisdom, to attempt to break the deadlock. Grossmann writes:\nOur chief goal was to explore the possibility of a scientific consensus on the psychological characteristics of wisdom and best practices for its measurement. We hoped to take down wisdom from its mystical pedestal and find a more pragmatic concrete footing that would work not just for sages and fictional charcters, but also for regular humans.[2]\nMeta-cognition and moral aspiration The consensus reached by Grossmann and his colleagues was that this slippery thing called \u0026ldquo;wisdom\u0026rdquo; seems to rest on two pillars. The first pillar is moral aspiration. This, more or less, is the aspiration that we might have, among all the complexity and confusion of everyday life, to do the right thing. The second pillar is meta-cognition. This is the ability to think about thinking, or to subject our thinking to scrutiny, rather than simply taking it for granted.\nFor Grossmann, these two work together. Without one or the other, wisdom is either lopsided or non-existent. Moral aspiration without meta-cognition can be naive and destructive. On the other hand, meta-cognition without moral aspiration looks like a kind of sociopathy, a low cunning that is only interested in gain. But taken together, the two of these balance each other out and set us on a course for better, wiser lives.\nIf this description of wisdom feels familiar, it is because we have encountered it before, in the person of Socrates. The Greek philosopher hungered to know what things like \u0026ldquo;virtue\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;piety\u0026rdquo; meant: he was the embodiment of moral aspiration. And he also subjected his own thinking, and the thinking of others, to severe scrutiny. He had the humility to know how much he didn\u0026rsquo;t know. This looks very like meta-cognition.\nA tree bearing apples labelled with virtues, including wisdom. Coloured lithograph, 1870, after J. Bakewell, 1771.. Credit: Wellcome Collection. Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nWhy we still need philosophy So it might seem that what was once the province of the philosophers is now, at long last, put on a firm footing so that it can be understood scientifically. From the confusing mix of elements bundled together by the philosophers, we have isolated two things that are theoretically measurable. This means that we can set about measuring them, and then we can think about wisdom more systematically.\nBut things are not quite so simple. It is true that Grossmann and his colleagues have taken elements of various philosophical traditions, and boiled them down to two measurable things that relate in some way to some philosophical accounts of wisdom. But we should also ask what this two-pillar account of wisdom leaves out.\nThe first thing to notice is that this account makes wisdom a personal achievement: both meta-cognition and moral aspiration are more individual than collective goods. But what about more social visions of wisdom? You can imagine that after hearing about moral aspiration and meta-cognition, Mencius might shake his head and say that this is all very well, but what about the cattle grazing on ox mountain, and the broader social conditions that support wisdom?\nA second argument against this as a final and definitive account of wisdom is that it risks down-playing the problems with moral aspiration. As we saw in the last piece on moral foolishness, moral aspiration can be a serious cause of division. And this is something that both Socrates and the Zhuangzi seemed to agree on. It might possibly be that with enough meta-cognition, the down-sides of moral aspiration can be kept in check. But it is not clear that this is the case.\nAnother thing to notice is that this is an account that sees wisdom as something incremental, rather than something that represents a radical break with the everyday. Here we have to ask about whose moral aspiration we are talking about. Think of Diogenes with his lamp, lurching around Athens and pouring scorn on his contemporaries. Or think of the philosopher who is weird and out-of-place, who is atopos. There\u0026rsquo;s a risk that this scientific account of wisdom is too safe, too supportive of current social structures. What about the wisdom that disrupts the consensus by means of which we live—even at the cost of seeming like madness—and tries to show the hidden madness within our everyday lives?\nAnd this leads to a final objection. Any account of wisdom, it seems, must necessarily imply a particular vision of the good life. So to say that we have cracked the idea of wisdom once and for all is to commit ourselves, whether by accident or design, to one particular model of the good life. A society of those who are skilled in meta-cognition (those who are good at thinking about their own thinking) and who possess strong moral aspirations (those who desire goodness) doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound too bad. But it reflects a very specific set of values, not all of which would be shared by the philosophers we have been talking about over the duration of this course. And we would do well to remember that there may be more than one form of the good life.\nThis is not to say that scientific research like this is without value. It is only to say that we need to recognise its limitations, rather than assuming that the job of philosophy has been taken over by the empirical sciences. Because when it comes to the complexity of human lives, philosophy always has a habit of creeping back in, just when you least expect it…\nDiscussion questions What benefits do you think there might be to taking a scientific approach to wisdom? Grossmann suggests that wisdom rests upon two pillars: meta-cognition and moral aspiration. Do you think this account is complete enough? Or would you build a few more pillars? If so, which ones? Of the objections raised here to the idea of wisdom as a topic for scientific study, which if any is the strongest? And which is the weakest?

            "content": "Life Empedocles was a philosopher from the city of Akragas in Sicily. His traditional dates are around c. 494 BCE to c. 434 BCE, although these are uncertain. He came from a family of aristocrats, and his grandfather, also called Empedocles, was allegedly a skilled horseman who won the crown for his riding skills at the Olympic Games.\nThe dandyish shaman Some have argued that Empedocles studied with philosophers such as Xenophanes and Anaximander, although this is largely speculation. There is some evidence that he was influenced by Parmenides and by the Pythagorean school. Despite his aristocratic origins, some early accounts paint him as a defender of ordinary people against the iniquities imposed upon them by the rich.\nBut in the tradition, Empedocles does not fit with the image of a sober-minded philosopher. Instead, he seems to have been more like a wandering healer, poet, medicine-man and shaman. Tradition also holds that he was a snappy dresser, who liked to wear bronze sandals and a laurel wreath. And if this seems like an affectation, it is in keeping with stories that Empedocles styled himself as a living god. Here is how Empedocles describes himself in the story told by the chronically unreliable Diogenes Laërtius:\nI, in your eyes a deathless god, no longer mortal,go among all, honoured, just as I seem:wreathed with ribbons and festive garlands.As soon as I arrive in flourishing cities I am reveredby all, men and women. And they follow at once,in their ten thousands, asking where is the path to gain, some in need of divinations, others in all sorts of diseases sought to hear a healing oracle\u0026hellip;The Poem of Empedocles, Trans. Brad Inwood, p. 81\nInto the furnace Empedocles\u0026rsquo; god delusions may, according to one famous story, have eventually got the better of him. According to the legend, Empedocles threw himself into the mouth of Mount Etna in an attempt to prove his immortality. The legend says that the volcano happily swallowed the philosopher whole, but it spat out one of his fancy bronze sandals.\nThe story is entertaining, and has had a long history; but there is, alas, no evidence any of it is true.\nPhilosophy Like several other early Greek philosophers, including Parmenides and Xenophanes, Empedocles wrote his philosophy in verse. In the later philosophical tradition, Plato made a stark distinction between poetry and philosophy; but for many early Greek philosophers, the two went hand-in-hand.\nAnd as with many other early Greek philosophers, Empedocles was obsessed by the question of how to account for both regularity and change.\nThe four roots Empedocles argued that all existing things have four \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo;: fire, air, water and earth. He argued that these corresponded to the gods Zeus, Hera, Nestis (or Persephone) and Aidoneus:\nFirst, hear of the four roots of all things,gleaming Zeus and life-bringing Hera and Aidoneusand Nestis, who moistens with tears the spring of mortals.The Poem of Empedocles, Trans. Brad Inwood, p. 218\nThe fact that Empedocles associates these four \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo; with gods suggests he\u0026rsquo;s talking about something a bit more intangible than material elements. But whatever these four \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo; are, for Empedocles, they are the unchanging source of everything that changes and grows and decays in the world. So underneath the changing world, there is a constant set of principles. And these fundamental roots are themselves unchanging, neither coming into existence nor being destroyed.\nBut how does this change happen? The answer that Empedocles gives is that it happens through the interaction of love (philotes) and strife (neikos).\nLove, strife and creativity One way of seeing love and strife is as the forces of attraction and repulsion. The later writer Alexander of Aphrodisias (c. 150 - 215 CE) suggests that Empedocles drew his ideas from the observation of magnetism. If you try to force two north poles of a magnet together (or two south poles) you feel repulsion. If you bring together a north and south pole, you feel attraction.\nAnd it isn\u0026rsquo;t just magnets. The whole world — from magnets to human interactions — seems to be governed by the interplay of \u0026lsquo;push\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;pull\u0026rsquo; forces. So Empedocles argued that the world is underpinned by love and strife. Love is the force that unites things, that brings them together. Love mixes and blends and combines. Strife is the counter-force that separates things out. What is crucial for Empedocles is that both love and strife are important for the creative processes of the universe. Creativity consists both in the process of separation, and in the process of unification.\nAs the philosopher Brad Inwood writes, \u0026lsquo;all creative activity\u0026hellip; requires a delicate balance of love and strife.\u0026rsquo; If strife won out, everything would revert to the four roots, and nothing much would happen. If love won out, everything would mix together into one single lump, and there could be no change or growth.\nAnd these things never cease from constantly alternating,at one time all coming together by love into one,and at another time again all being borne apart separately by the hostility of strife.The Poem of Empedocles, Trans. Brad Inwood, p. 225\nFurther Reading Books The poem of Empedocles: a text and translation with an introduction by Brad Inwood (University of Toronto Press 2001) is an excellent, accessible translation, with lots of supporting material, and the original Greek text.\nOnline Resources This essay on Empedocles gives more background on love, strife and the four \u0026lsquo;roots\u0026rsquo;, using some metaphors drawn from jazz.\nAlso, try this episode on Empedocles from The History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps.\n",

            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "If philosophy has always been preoccupied with wisdom, its relationship with the opposite of wisdom—foolishness—has always been a vexed one. One reason for this is that throughout the history of philosophy, the relationship between wisdom and foolishness has not been one of simple opposition. Instead, it seems that for some philosophers, at least, there is a kind of wisdom in foolishness.\nWe already know that Socrates was a self-confessed know-nothing. And also we know that for the Zhuangzi there is something wise in giving up in the pursuit of wisdom. So when thinking through what it means to be wise, we are going to have to ask what it means to be foolish.\nLooking for the light: The wise fool and the lamp The idea of the Wise Fool has a long history. This history goes back at least as far as Socrates. Arguably, Socrates was both a fool (he was ignorant) and wise (he knew he was ignorant). Being both wise and a fool, he was able to fool with those who claimed wisdom for themselves, and in fooling with them, he could demonstrate that they too were fools — only more foolish fools than he was himself.\nThe Wise Fool is someone who, in their search for wisdom, appears foolish in the eyes of the world. In the ancient Greek world, the philosopher Diogenes the Cynic was even more well-known than Socrates for his foolish wisdom. In one famous story about Diogenes,\nPlato defined Man as a featherless biped. The definition was generally well received. But Diogenes refuted it by plucking a chicken, bringing it to Plato’s Academy, plopping it down and proclaiming, ‘There’s Plato’s Man for you!’ [1]\nPlato was, unsurprisingly, not impressed by Diogenes. He allegedly described him as \u0026lsquo;Socrates with a screw loose.\u0026rsquo; [2] And Diogenes\u0026rsquo;s behaviour was admittedly bizarre. Another much-retold anecdote is that he went around in full daylight holding up a lamp. When people asked him what he was doing, he said, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;m searching for an honest man.\u0026rsquo; [3]\nImage from UK Office of War Information 1943-5. Artist Unknown. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nDiogenes was a philosopher who mixed extravagant showmanship with a taste for ribald comedy. And he had a sharp awareness of the foolishness of everyday life. Plato\u0026rsquo;s description was apt: like Socrates, Diogenes called his fellow-citizens to account; but the ways in which he did so were more extreme. He was renowned, for example, for public masturbation. When challenged about his behaviour, he said, \u0026lsquo;If only rubbing the stomach could alleviate hunger pains so easily.\u0026rsquo; [4]\nDiogenes parading with his lamp through Athens is itself a kind of performance: he shows himself to be a fool (who needs a lamp in daylight?); but in making a scene like this, he is also underlining the fact there is nobody in the whole city who is a straight-up, honest human being.\nThis idea of the Wise Fool and their lamp recurred throughout the literary and philosophical traditions of Europe, and also spread beyond to the Islamic world. It appears in Aesop\u0026rsquo;s Fables, where Aesop himself is the fool with a lamp. Although as a historical figure Aesop predated Diogenes, many of the stories in the Fables are later attributions, and so it is likely that the story of Aesop is based on the story of Diogenes, and not vice versa.\nOnce when Aesop happened to be the only slave in his master’s household, he was ordered to prepare dinner earlier than usual. He thus had to visit a few houses looking for fire, until at last he found a place where he could light his lamp. Since his search had taken him out of his way along a winding path, he decided to shorten his journey on the way back and go straight through the forum. There amidst the crowds a talkative fellow shouted at him, ‘Aesop, what are you doing with a lamp in the middle of the day?’ ‘I’m just looking to see if I can find a real man’, said Aesop, as he quickly made his way back home. [5]\nEchoes of this story appear again in the Islamic world. In traditions of Islamic storytelling, the exemplary Wise Fool is the Mullah Nasreddin. Nasreddin is a hard figure to pin down historically. Some accounts say he was Turkish and lived in the 13th century. Others say he was from Iraq and lived four centuries earlier. Still other accounts say he was from Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, or Iran. But whether or not there was a historical model for Nasreddin, the stories are remarkably consistent. In these tales, Nasreddin alternates, \u0026lsquo;between the wise man and the fool, the wit and the numbskull.\u0026rsquo; [6]\nTwo stories about Nasreddin and lamps seem to owe something to the tale of Diogenes. Here is the first:\n\u0026lsquo;I can see in the dark,\u0026rsquo; boasted Nasreddin one day in the teahouse. \u0026lsquo;If that is so, why do we sometimes see you carrying a light through the streets?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Only to prevent other people from colliding with me.\u0026rsquo; [7]\nAnd here is the second, which is more well-known, and is the kind of story you get told at annoying training events.\nSomeone saw Nasreddin searching for something on the ground. \u0026lsquo;What have you lost, Mulla ?\u0026rsquo; he asked. \u0026lsquo;My key,\u0026rsquo; said the Mulla. So they both went down on their knees and looked for it. After a time the other man asked: \u0026lsquo;Where exactly did you drop it ?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;In my own house.\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Then why are you looking here?\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;There is more light here than inside my own house.\u0026rsquo; [8]\nThese stories may or may not be the heirs of the tales about Diogenes, but in repeating the trope of the Wise Fool and their lamp, they seem to owe something to the Greek tale. A more direct borrowing is found in volume five of the Masnavi of the 13th century Sufi mystic Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī, better known simply as Rumi. In Rumi\u0026rsquo;s tale, a Christian saint appears in the marketplace with a burning lamp.\nThat person was going about in a bazaar in the daytime with a candle, his heart full of love and (spiritual) ardour. A busybody said to him, \u0026lsquo;Hey, O such-and-such, what are you seeking beside every shop? Hey, why are you going about in search (of something) with a lamp in bright daylight? What is the joke?\u0026rsquo; [9]\nThe mystic responds with a strange series of images. He says that his questioner is preoccupied only with the foam on the surface of things, and so he misses the significance of the sea. And he says that only when we can see beyond the foam of surface appearances is it possible to grasp hold of the deeper truths beneath, and free ourselves from hypocrisy.\nHe that regards the foam-flakes is (engaged) in reckoning (and calculation), while he that regards the Sea is without (conscious) volition.\nHe that regards the foam is in (continual) movement, while he that regards the Sea is devoid of hypocrisy. [10]\nSea-foam and ocean. Illustration to \u0026ldquo;The Tale of tsar Saltan\u0026rdquo; by Ivan Bilibin. Public Domain via Wikimedia Commons.\nThe madness of the philosophers The idea that wisdom might look like folly, at least from some points of view, is one that goes back to Plato\u0026rsquo;s famous allegory of the cave in the Republic. In this allegory, Socrates asks us to imagine the mass of humankind like prisoners chained up in a cave, a fire blazing behind them. Between the prisoners and the fire pass a shadowy bunch of puppeteers. These puppeteers carry models of things like ducks and cows and tables and jumbo jets. The prisoners see the flickering shadows of the puppets on the wall, and they think, \u0026lsquo;Look, a duck! A cow! A table! A chair! A jumbo jet!\u0026rsquo; And they take these flickering shadows for the whole of reality.\nBut then one day, one of the prisoners is released and forced out of the cave into the sunlight. There they see reality in all its unadorned richness. They see real ducks and cows. They see tables and chairs. Jumbo jets pass overhead. Reality is so much more than they had imagined. Before they only saw shadows of models of real things. Now they see the things themselves.\nSo, moved by compassion for their former prison-mates, they hurry back down to the cave to tell them. But once they get there, as they babble about the things they have seen, their former companions just look at them in bewilderment. What is this strange person talking about? Their stories of the world outside the cave invite ridicule, even the possibility of violence. Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t the prisoners think that their recently-returned companions were mad, Socrates asks, and put them to death (just as Socrates himself was to suffer a violent death of his own)?\nThe allegory of the cave is a complicated one (and will be the subject of a forthcoming Philosopher File. But it brings home a paradox baked into the heart of certain ideas of wisdom. If wisdom is seen as something remote and inaccessible, something radically different from the usual way of seeing the world, then in the eyes of the world, wisdom will look pretty strange, perhaps even indistinguishable from madness. To the wise, everyday life might look like madness; but to those of us stumbling through our everyday lives, wisdom may look equally mad. It was a point made by the Renaissance writer, Erasmus, in his In Praise of Folly:\nAnd so it ordinarily fares with men as it fared in Plato’s myth, I gather, between those who admired shadows, still bound in the cave, and that one who broke away and, returning to the doorway, proclaimed that he had seen realities and that they who believed nothing existed except shadows were greatly deceived. Just as this wise man pitied and deplored the madness of those who were gripped by such an error, they, on their side, derided him as if he were raving, and cast him out.[11]\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s Allegory of the Cave, by Michiel Coxie c. 1510. Musée de la Chartreuse de Douai. Public domain.\nOn Moral Fools In Plato\u0026rsquo;s dialogues, Socrates is sometimes referred to as atopos, literally \u0026lsquo;out of place.\u0026rsquo; He is strange and hard to place. And this strangeness was shared by many ancient Greek philosophers. As the French philosopher Pierre Hadot writes, in the Greek world, it was taken as read that philosophers are often awkward cases. They don\u0026rsquo;t fit in. Their \u0026lsquo;mode of being and living\u0026rsquo; corresponds to a different vision from that of the mainstream. But while living in this radically different way, for the philosophers looking back at daily life, this life \u0026lsquo;must necessarily appear abnormal, like a state of madness, unconsciousness, and ignorance of reality.\u0026rsquo;[12]\nThese days, few philosophers would go quite this far. And even fewer have the sheer performative panache of Diogenes. The idea that philosophy might lead us to apparent foolishness is not necessarily a popular one among contemporary philosophers. Nevertheless, some contemporary philosophers have continued to argue that there is a kind of wisdom to be found in foolishness.\nOne recent example is the philosopher Hans-Georg Moeller. In his book The Moral Fool, he draws on the philosophical traditions of Daoism and Zen Buddhism to argue that our moral hang-ups work to our individual and collective detriment.\nMoeller points out there a lack of any correlation between the amount of moral communication there is in a society, and how functional (or dysfunctional) that society is:\nIt is not the case that a relative lack of moral communication is correlated with a society in relative disorder or that a surge in moral communication is correlated with a society in relative peace. I also do not see how an increase in moral communication has ever made the world, or a person, in any empirical sense \u0026lsquo;better.\u0026rsquo; [13]\nIn fact, the reverse if often true: wars and conflicts do correlate with high doses of moral communication. It is hard to justify a war in anything other than moral terms. So Moeller proposes that we might be better off owning up to the fact that we are moral fools, and that we don\u0026rsquo;t really know what we\u0026rsquo;re up to when it comes to ethics.\nThe consequence, Moeller suggests, is what could be called a quiet de-escalation of ethics as we embrace our own moral foolishness. The moral fool is not, Moeller says, an \u0026rsquo;ethical anti-hero.\u0026rsquo; Instead, the moral fool is \u0026lsquo;a more modest fellow\u0026rsquo; who simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t know if the moral perspective is necessarily good, and so is averse to making moral judgements. The moral fool is nobody special: they are just somebody who has made peace with their moral foolishness.\nIn one respect, Moeller\u0026rsquo;s moral fool is like Socrates. This strange and unexemplary character admits, as did Socrates, to not knowing what virtue is (and in this sense, we are all sometimes Moral Fools). But then the moral fool goes beyond Socrates. Because Socrates, in coming to this conclusion, redoubles his search for virtue. Meanwhile, the moral fool, knowing that virtue causes all kinds of problems, simply gives up on the search. And having given up, the moral fool wanders off in their own sweet, purposeless foolish way. In this, perhaps, there is wisdom of a sort\u0026hellip;\nDiscussion questions This time, you can see an old argument that wisdom involves a radical change of value-system. So from the point of view of ordinary people, philosophers (who are wise) will appear mad. And from the point of view of philosophers (who are, allegedly, wise), ordinary people will appear mad. But is the split really that stark? Must philosophers always be atopos? Are there any dangers to seeing wisdom, or those who possess it, as atopos, or somehow \u0026lsquo;out of place\u0026rsquo;? If so, what are these dangers? Have you ever experienced anything that, at first glance, appears to be utterly foolish, but on closer inspection seems to be remarkably wise? For Moeller, the moral fool is somebody who embraces their moral foolishness, and gives up on the quest for moral certainty. If we were all to become moral fools, how would the world change? Would it be better? Or would it be worse?

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Deng Xi (c. 545 - 501 BCE) was a lawyer from the state of Zheng, where he also served as an official. He is said to have written two works, but neither of them survive.\nDeng Xi is chiefly famous for his unsettling approach to argument. He was famous for being able to \u0026rsquo;turn wrong into right and right into wrong,\u0026rsquo; and according to The Annals of Lü Buwei, he didn\u0026rsquo;t recognise any fixed standard for evaluating arguments. This made him formidable in court: untethered from questions of objective truth or falsity, his powers of persuasion often won the day, whatever the details of the case. As a result, Deng Xi became a popular lawyer. Legend has it that he would charge his clients a coat for major legal cases, and leg-wear for minor legal cases. He quickly developed such an extensive wardrobe that he became rich.\nLetters and loopholes Deng\u0026rsquo;s great rival was the prime minister Zi Chan, who was committed to laws and punishments, and who is often identified as a legalist (see also Guan Zhong).\nIn one famous story, Zi Chan issued a law that forbade the public posting of open letters criticising the Duke of Zheng. Deng Xi responded by instead delivering his critiques of the ruler direct to his intended audiences. Zi Chan changed the law to forbid the direct delivery of political critiques. So Deng Xi resorted to indirect delivery, smuggling in the letters by enclosing them with other deliveries. As the Annals of Lü Buwei put it, \u0026lsquo;The government ordinances were inexhaustible, but his devices to evade them were equally inexhaustible.\u0026rsquo;\nThe traditional accounts say that Deng Xi\u0026rsquo;s enthusiasm for causing legal havoc led eventually to his execution. And yet other accounts suggest that the philosopher was unfairly maligned because after Deng died, the ruler of Zheng adopted his legal code.\nPhilosophy It would be easy to see Deng\u0026rsquo;s approach to argumentation as being based merely in self-interest. But Deng also points to a more profound problem: however precise you are in defining the terms of the law, it is still possible to evade it. Every new law opens up opportunities for a new set of loopholes that can be exploited by opportunists, which in turn can be remedied by further laws (some argue that this is why, for example, tax legislation in the UK extends to over ten million words). This points to larger questions of logic and language: can language can fully capture all the diverse circumstances of the world, however precise that language might be?\nNames and things Deng Xi is often seen as a representative of what is called the School of Names, or ming jia. The term is one that was invented in the Han dynasty (around the 2nd Century BCE) to refer to a group of earlier philosophers who were concerned logic and language. The earlier term for this miscellaneous bunch of philosophers was the \u0026lsquo;disputers\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;rhetoricians\u0026rsquo; (bian zhe). But whatever term is used to refer to them, these philosophers were preoccupied above all with the gap between names (or ming) and things (shi). How do words refer to things? And what does language miss when we try to refer to many things and circumstances in the world?\nIn Ancient China, disputation was not necessarily seen as a bad thing. Some philosophers argued that disputation served to clarify thinking, to more effectively communicate knowledge, and to separate out ideas to explore them more clearly. But Chinese philosophers also recognised that there was a down-side to disputation: it could be a way of twisting the ideas of others, tangling them up, and tying people in knots.\nThe floating corpse Deng Xi was well-known for his idea of the acceptability of opposing arguments. This was known as his teaching of liang ke or \u0026lsquo;double admissibility.\u0026rsquo; In other words, you can argue that X is the case, but you can equally well argue that not-X is the case; and if you have sufficient skill in argument, then there\u0026rsquo;s no way of choosing between them.\nDeng Xi seems to have enjoyed putting the philosophical cat among the pigeons. The following story is particularly famous:\nThe Wei river was extremely high. A person from the house of a rich man of Zheng drowned. Someone found the body. The rich man asked to buy it back. The man demanded very much money. The rich man told Deng Xi about it. Deng Xi said, “Calm down about it. There’s certainly no one else he can sell it to.” The one who found the body was troubled by this and told Deng Xi about it. Deng Xi replied to him too by saying, “Calm down about it. There’s certainly nowhere else they can buy it.” —From The Annals of Lü Buwei (18.4/453), translated Chris Fraser.\nThis is not exactly an example of liang ke or \u0026lsquo;double admissibility,\u0026rsquo; as there is no logical contradiction between the two claims. But it demonstrates Deng\u0026rsquo;s willingness to argue on both sides of an argument.\nFurther Reading Books Bryan W. Van Norden\u0026rsquo;s Introduction to Classical Chinese philosophy (Hackett 2011) has a good, brief introduction to the School of Names and to Deng Xi.\nOnline Resources Chris Fraser has written a great supplement to the Stanford Encyclopedia Online entry on the School of Names, recounting Deng Xi\u0026rsquo;s exploits. As Fraser cautions, these accounts were written more than two centuries after Deng\u0026rsquo;s death, so cannot be considered to be historically accurate.\n",

            "content": "Wisdom, virtue and the art of cultivation If wisdom is something desirable, something to which we can aspire, then how do we go about becoming wiser? We saw in the second piece on Aristotle that wisdom involves both thinking (theoria) and doing (praxis). A wise person is somebody who thinks about things clearly and who also acts well. They have both intellectual and practical virtues. And ideally, these virtues support each other. Intellectual virtues help orientate our actions, and virtuous actions help support clearer ways of thinking and seeing.\nBut can we really cultivate wiser, more virtuous ways of acting and thinking? Or are we stuck with being foolish and unvirtuous? This is a question that appears in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Meno, where Socrates and the military commander Meno discuss the nature of virtue, and whether it can be learned. Socrates argues that \u0026ldquo;virtue, being beneficial, must be a kind of wisdom.\u0026quot;[1] But wisdom is a slippery thing for Socrates. His own claims to wisdom only went as far as acknowledging his lack of wisdom. So where does this leave the possibility of actively cultivating wisdom, whether we are talking about theoria or praxis? By the end of the dialogue, Socrates and Meno have not answered this question, nor have they succeeded in working out what virtue actually is. All Socrates will say is that virtue \u0026ldquo;appears to be present in those of us who may possess it as a gift from the gods.\u0026quot;[2]\nTaking Socrates\u0026rsquo;s view in the Meno, it is not clear that virtue (or practical wisdom) can be cultivated at all. Either the gods bestow it on us or they don\u0026rsquo;t. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t get us very far. But if we turn from Plato\u0026rsquo;s teacher Socrates to his student Aristotle (c. 384 — 322 BCE), we find a more promising account of what it means to cultivate practical wisdom.\nSo in this week\u0026rsquo;s piece, we\u0026rsquo;re going to explore Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s views on the cultivation of wisdom, and also the account of cultivation given by the Chinese philosopher (and exact contemporary of Aristotle) Mencius or Mengzi (c. 385 — c. 303 BCE).\nCultivation and growth For all the differences of the societies in which Mencius and Aristotle lived, they shared many concerns. Both of them were systematisers, attempting to wrestle the traditions that they inherited into a more rigorous form. Both of them were preoccupied with the question of how we can cultivate human nature so that we become wiser, better people. And they both saw human nature as itself something rooted in the ability to grow and change.\nFor Mencius and Aristotle alike, human nature is not just about what we are, but it is also about how we develop. The word for \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; in Greek is physis. From this root, we get words like \u0026ldquo;physics\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;physical.\u0026rdquo; In its earliest uses, the word physis referred to the growth of plants (it appears with this meaning in Book 10 of Homer\u0026rsquo;s *Odyssey*)**. By the time of the philosopher Heraclitus, the term was being used in philosophy to refer to processes of growth and development more broadly. So when applied to ourselves, our human nature or our physis is not just a matter of what we are, but also what we could grow into.\nFrom Kräuterbuch by J.F. Schreiber (c.1905), Public Domain via Biodiversity Heritage Library.\nSimilar metaphors appear over in China, where the term that is usually translated as \u0026ldquo;nature\u0026rdquo; is xing. The Chinese character 性 is made up of two components. The component on the left (忄) means \u0026ldquo;heart\u0026rdquo;, and the component on the right (sheng 生) depicts a plant growing out of the soil, with a shoot springing from one of the side-branches. The scholar Sarah Allan writes,\nRecent scholarship recognizes that xing is a dynamic, not a static term. Its dynamic aspects can best be understood if we think of it in terms of a metaphor deriving from the organic world. Xing\u0026hellip; is not so much the \u0026ldquo;qualities that a thing has to start with\u0026rdquo; or even the \u0026ldquo;sum total of our genetic and individual inheritance,\u0026rdquo; but the potential contained by a seed or the first shoots of a seedling to become a fully developed plant. [3]\nOur nature, or xing, is about how we grow and develop, how our shoots and seedlings grow to become fully developed plants. So whether we are talking about Greek physis or Chinese xing, the vision of human nature here is organic and supple and capable of growth and development. We are, as contemporary philosopher Martha Nussbaum writes, \u0026ldquo;more like a plant than like a jewel, something rather fragile, but whose very particular beauty is inseparable from its fragility.\u0026rdquo;\nAristotle on flourishing If we are plant-like by nature, then this raises the question of how we can best cultivate ourselves so we can flourish. For Aristotle, the physis or nature of a thing involves several factors (or \u0026ldquo;causes\u0026rdquo; as they are sometimes called): what that thing is made of (its material cause); how it is put together (its formal cause); the vagaries of its own history and experiences (its efficient causes); and the question of what it is for (its final cause). The last of these is important when applied to human life because it says that the question of what we are is bound up with the question of what we could be. Human life is a work in progress, one that can reach its natural fullness through living in a particular way.\nFor Aristotle, a fully human life is one in which we cultivate ourselves so that we can fully use our capacities and faculties in pursuit of a good end. Aristotle calls this full use of our capacities \u0026ldquo;eudaimonia\u0026rdquo;, which is sometimes translated as \u0026ldquo;happiness\u0026rdquo;, but means something closer to \u0026ldquo;flourishing.\u0026rdquo; Our flourishing may depend to some extent on external conditions; but for Aristotle, it is not just something that happens to us. Instead, it is a way of going about our lives. It is doing well in both senses of the word: in the sense of acting well, and in the sense of living well. \u0026ldquo;The happy (or flourishing) person,\u0026rdquo; Aristotle writes in the Nicomachean Ethics, \u0026ldquo;lives well and acts well, for we have claimed that happiness is pretty much a kind of living well and acting well.\u0026quot;[4]\nThis means that for Aristotle, our flourishing is inseparable from our living and acting well: it is inseparable from virtue. Flourishing, Aristotle says, is \u0026ldquo;a certain kind of activity of the soul in accordance with virtue.\u0026quot;[5] To cultivate ourselves, we need to cultivate virtues. We need to develop a particular set of dispositions and character traits that fully express what it means to live and act well. And if we cultivate these dispositions (for example — friendliness, generosity, courage, truthfulness and so on), then whatever situation we find ourselves in, we will act wisely.\nMencius and the four sprouts Over in China, the philosopher Mencius was similarly preoccupied with virtue. Mencius systematised and developed the philosophical legacy left by Confucius. And like Aristotle, he saw human virtue involving a suite of different qualities and dispositions. Mencius argued that by nature (xing), we all have four \u0026ldquo;sprouts\u0026rdquo; (duan) of virtue. But these sprouts need to be nourished if they are to grow into vigorous forests of goodness.\nThese four sprouts are ren (仁) or humaneness, yi (義) or justice, li (禮) or ritual, and zhi (智) or wisdom (see the first article in this series for more on zhi). Mencius says that ren is associated with feelings of pity and compassion towards others. It is a kind of fellow-feeling for other human beings, an expression of our natural compassion. Yi is associated with a sense of shame, with the inner feeling for whether we are acting well or badly. It is our internal moral compass, our feel for fairness and unfairness, and what is right or not right. Li is an ability to navigate the shared ritual norms of human social life with grace and elegance. It is about knowing when to go along with something, and when to politely decline, when to act and when to not act, when to engage and when not. It is, Mencius says, the heart or mind that respects others. And zhi is the ability to distinguish between what is and what isn\u0026rsquo;t the case, what is and what isn\u0026rsquo;t true.\nOn ox mountain For Mencius, human nature is inherently good in that we all have these sprouts. But for this goodness to grow and flourish, these sprouts need to be cultivated. This cultivation, Mencius makes clear, is not just something that we do on our own: we have a role to play in tending to the sprouts of our virtues, but the conditions in which we live also have an impact on how much or how little we flourish.\nHere Mencius tells one of his loveliest and most famous stories. It is a story about a mountain called Niu Shan, or Ox Mountain\nThe trees of Ox Mountain were once beautiful. But because it bordered on a large state, hatchets and axes besieged it. Could it remain verdant? Due to the respite it got during the day or night, and the moisture of rain and dew, there were sprouts and shoots growing there. But oxen and sheep came and grazed on them. Hence, it was as if it were barren. Seeing it barren, people believed that there had never been any timber there. But could this be the nature of the mountain? [6]\nCattle resting in open landscape.

Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\nWe see the mountains of human life barren of virtues and wisdom, and we think that this is what human beings are: they are unvirtuous and unwise by nature. But we are wrong. If this is what we are seeing, Mencius says that the reason is that something in the world has gone very wrong, and has got in the way of our natural tendency to flourish.\nMencius\u0026rsquo;s vision of what it means to flourish is not just a personal one, but also a political one. As Sarah Allan writes:\nlike plants, which have an innate tendency to grow and are fed even by the evening moisture but cannot withstand continually being hewn down, the mind or heart has an innate tendency to be good that will try to reassert itself, but eventually be overcome by outside pressure.[7]\nMencius was addressing his philosophy not to individuals, but to the rulers of his day, attempting to persuade them to put in place the kind of just and stable social order that, he argued, could support the flourishing of virtue. He argued that hunger and poverty, injustice and need, create chaotic and destructive environments that get in the way of the flourishing of virtue and wisdom. So if we care about the cultivation of wisdom and virtue, for Mencius, we also need to ask about the social and political conditions that can support this cultivation.\nSocial goods The idea of cultivation can be a challenging one. If wisdom and virtue are things that can be cultivated, and if we are capable of plant-like growth and change, this implies that we are not stuck with who we are. If we are mean-spirited, we can become less mean-spirited. If we are bad-tempered, we can become less bad-tempered. And we are foolish with money, we can learn to become more prudent. We are, to some extent, responsible for who we become.\nBut as Mencius reminds us, the development of virtue is not always easy, and sometimes our own attempts may be thwarted by adverse conditions. You might think that this gets us off the hook: if we are unvirtuous, we can just blame our bad upbringing, or say it is simply because we live in a brutal society. But arguably, Mencius\u0026rsquo;s social vision of what it means to flourish doesn\u0026rsquo;t so much get as off the hook, as do the opposite. Because in Mencius\u0026rsquo;s vision, virtue and wisdom are not just individual goods. They are also social goods. So we need to ask ourselves not only how we can cultivate our own virtue and wisdom, but also how we can put in place the conditions that can support the cultivation of others. And the more we are flourishing individually, the more capacity we then have—and the more responsibility—to attend to this social flourishing.\nDiscussion questions Are Mencius and Aristotle right in the claim that wisdom and virtue can be cultivated? Or are we simply stuck with who we are? What are the limits of cultivation? If they are right, is this cultivation a good thing? Or does it (as the Zhuangzi argues) simply a cause of trouble and strife? What do you personally need to flourish? Is flourishing something that you can do regardless of circumstances? Or are there external conditions that are important to you in your own flourishing? In his account of flourishing, Aristotle says that \u0026ldquo;The happy (or flourishing) person, lives well and acts well.\u0026rdquo; But is there more to flourishing than living well and acting well? Mencius\u0026rsquo;s vision is of a society where the cultivation of wisdom and virtue is possible. What kind of society do you think would best support this cultivation? Notes [1] Meno 88d.

            "content": "Going with the gut How do we know what is the wise thing to do? What makes for a wise action? In the heat of the moment, how do we decide? If you talk to some philosophers, they might tell you that we simply have to reason things out. But experience suggests that things don\u0026rsquo;t work like this. More often than not, we don\u0026rsquo;t have time to sit down and theorise our way to an answer. As we saw in the article on Aristotle, practical wisdom is not simply the application of theory to specific circumstances, but instead it is a different kind of thing.\nBut what kind of thing? When we don\u0026rsquo;t have the luxury of sufficient time to reason things out, how do we make decisions? Often, we go with our feelings, or with our gut instincts. So in this piece, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about these feelings and gut instincts. Because if this is how we often make decisions, we need to ask what role the guts (and the rest of our bodies) play in the pursuit of wisdom.\nSocrates against the flesh There is a tradition of philosophy going back to Ancient Greece that sees the body as little more than a burden or an impediment, something that gets in the way of the life of the mind. Our body might be useful for getting us from A to B, but essentially, if we care about philosophy, it is a trouble-maker.\nThis view can be traced back to Plato\u0026rsquo;s account of Socrates\u0026rsquo;s final hours in the Phaedo. At the time the dialogue is set, Socrates is seventy years old. The court in Athens has just sentenced him to death for corrupting the minds of the young. His sentence is that he should drink poison made of hemlock. Now Socrates in prison, surrounded by his grieving friends. And to comfort them, Socrates talks about the body and the soul, and why death is nothing to be feared because it is simply the severing of the soul and the body. Socrates asks his friends:\nDo we believe that death is this, namely, that the body comes to be separated by itself apart from the soul, and the soul comes to be separated by itself apart from the body? Is death anything else than that? **** [1]\nSocrates goes on to argue that for the lover of wisdom, the body just one great inconvenience. It is the source of the soul\u0026rsquo;s confusion. It \u0026ldquo;keeps us busy in a thousand ways.\u0026rdquo; It gets in the way of contemplation. And it is the cradle of the desires that lead to war, conflict and strife.\nThis means, Socrates argues, that if we are serious about wisdom we need to train ourselves in leaving our bodily needs behind, so we can attend instead to the needs of the soul. What is the philosopher, he asks, other than one who \u0026ldquo;frees the soul from association with the body as much as possible\u0026rdquo;? [2]\nThis is a view that recurs elsewhere in Plato\u0026rsquo;s work. In the Cratylus, Plato has Socrates speculate about the etymology of sōma, the Greek word for body, playing on the closeness of the words for \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo; (sōma) and \u0026ldquo;tomb\u0026rdquo; (sēma):\nThus some people say that the body (sōma) is the tomb (sēma) of the soul, on the grounds that it is entombed in its present life, while others say that it is correctly called ‘a sign’ (‘sēma) because the soul signifies whatever it wants to signify by means of the body. [3]\nPhilosophical indigestion Ever since Plato, this tendency to see the body as an impediment to wisdom—even as a prison for the soul—has reappeared again and again throughout the history of European philosophy. It is a theme that is often found in Christian thought: our mortal bodies are contrasted unfavourably with our immortal souls. And even now, there is a tendency to separate off the life of the mind and the life of the body, and to elevate the former at the expense of the latter.\nBut this separation and hierarchy seem increasingly hard to sustain in the light of contemporary science. As the neuroscientist Sarah Garfinkel has argued, when coming to understand the world, our bodies and our minds talk to each other. And this was an insight shared, in the 19th century, by Nietzsche. In his Thus Spake Zarathustra, Nietzsche protested against the way philosophy has overlooked the body. Railing against the \u0026ldquo;despisers of the body\u0026rdquo;, he wrote:\nThe body is a great reason, a multiplicity with one sense, a war and a peace, one herd and one shepherd. Your small reason, what you call “spirit” is also a tool of your body, my brother, a small work — and plaything of your great reason. There is more reason in your body than in your best wisdom. [4]\nFor Nietzsche, the great reason of the body trumps the wisdom of the mind. For most of his life, Nietzsche was afflicted by both physical and mental illness. He knew well how our minds depend upon the condition of our bodies. This is why, in one famous passage in his book Ecce Homo, Nietzsche blamed the indigestibility of German philosophy on the stodginess of the German diet.\nBut German cooking in general — what doesn\u0026rsquo;t it have on its conscience? Soup before the meal\u0026hellip; overcooked meats, vegetables cooked with fat and flour; the degeneration of starchy foods into paperweights! Just add to this the almost brutal post-prandial drinking habits of the ancient — but by no means only the ancient — Germans, and you will also understand the origin of the German spirit — from its depressive intestines\u0026hellip; the German spirit is indigestion, it is never through with anything. [5]\nYou are what you eat, Nietzsche is saying; and if you eat heavy food, you will inevitably produce heavy thoughts.\nTending to the body Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s condemnation of German cuisine may go too far, but it is a useful corrective to the view that we can only attain wisdom by unshackling ourselves from the body. If wisdom is anything at all, it surely should involve our whole organism, and not just our minds (as Socrates seems to suggest in the Phaedo).\nBut in Socrates\u0026rsquo;s defence, it is not at all clear that he did adhere to the views that Plato ascribed to him. In his Memoirs, another of Socrates\u0026rsquo;s students and friends, Xenophon, gives a strikingly different account of Socrates\u0026rsquo;s views on the relationship between the body and the mind. According to Xenophon, far from arguing we should be forgetful of the body and its needs, Socrates believed that without care of the body, our hopes for wisdom risk coming to nothing.\nThe body is valuable for all human activities, and in all its uses it is very important that it should be as fit as possible. Even in the act of thinking, which is supposed to require least assistance from the body, everyone knows that serious mistakes often happen through physical ill-health. Many people’s minds are often so invaded by forgetfulness, despondency, irritability and insanity because of their poor physical condition that their knowledge is actually driven out of them. [6]\nThe difference from the Socrates of the Phaedo is striking. According to Xenophon, Socrates saw bodily well-being is a prerequisite for wisdom. If you want to make wiser decisions and have wiser thoughts, Xenophon\u0026rsquo;s Socrates argues, the best place to start is to look after yourself: get a proper night\u0026rsquo;s sleep, eat good food, or take some exercise.\nHere Xenophon is in line with contemporary science, which increasingly shows how states of mind, emotional states, and bodily states are tangled up together.\nBodily practices Buddhism is a good example of bodily practices that support the cultivation of wisdom. The Kāyagatāsati Sutta, an early Buddhist text in the Pāli language, argues that cultivating awareness of the body is foundational for the attainment of wisdom. In the text, the Buddha says that a monk who seeks to attain wisdom,\nacts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness when defecating or urinating; who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent. [7]\nIn this view, wisdom begins with bodily attention. And the fulfilment of wisdom is not the separation of the mind from the body, but is itself both bodily and embodied. This idea that wisdom is something embodied appears also in the Confucian philosopher Mencius (also called Mengzi). Mencius writes: \u0026ldquo;The body is part of our Heaven-given nature. But only a sage can fulfil this body.” [8]\nAlso in China, the Zhuangzi focuses on the use of the body as a means of cultivation. As we saw in the previous piece in this series, the Zhuangzi is preoccupied with the limits of wisdom. One particularly striking passage says that \u0026ldquo;you have learned the wisdom of being wise, but not yet the wisdom of being free of wisdom.\u0026rdquo; But if we want to wisely free ourselves from wisdom, we need to engage in bodily practices. The Zhuangzi talks about \u0026ldquo;mind-fasting\u0026rdquo; (xinzhai in Chinese), and \u0026ldquo;sitting and forgetting\u0026rdquo; (zuowang), bodily practices of meditation that lead to this freedom.\nGood fortune comes to roost in stillness. To lack this stillness is called scurrying around even when sitting down. Allow your ears and eyes to open inward and thereby place yourself beyond your mind’s understanding consciousness [9]\nSomaesthetics In the late 20th century, the philosopher Richard Shusterman took up this idea that wisdom involves not just thinking, but also making use of our bodies in particular ways. Shusterman coined the term \u0026ldquo;somaesthetics,\u0026rdquo; which comes from the Greek for \u0026ldquo;body\u0026rdquo;, sōma, and aesthetics, from a Greek root meaning \u0026ldquo;to perceive\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;to feel\u0026rdquo;. Shusterman defines somaesthetics as follows:\nSomaesthetics can be provisionally defined as the critical meliorative study of one’s experience and use of one’s body as a locus of sensory-aesthetic appreciation (aesthesis) and creative self-fashioning. [10]\nThe indigestible nature of this may make you wonder whether Shusterman has himself indulging in stodgy snacks. But let\u0026rsquo;s pick it apart a bit. Somaesthetics is about both the experience and the use of the body. It is meliorative, meaning that it aims to help us find ways of living better, richer and fuller lives. And it is not just about exploring and appreciating what it is to be a living being, but also about exploring how we can fashion ourselves through attending to the body and bodily experience.\nSince Shusterman proposed the term, somaesthetics has grown to a huge area of contemporary study. It isn\u0026rsquo;t so much a single set of theories or practices as it is a broad approach to rethinking what it means to be embodied, and as embodied beings to live better, wiser lives. It puts our bodies centre stage, asking us to attend more closely to the feeling of what it means to be alive. And it asks about how, on this basis, we can reshape our lives.\nWhat all these traditions—from Buddhism, from Chinese thought, and from contemporary somaesthetics—suggest is that we cannot separate our search for wisdom from the question of what it means to be a living body. And instead of separating out the body and mind, as Plato has Socrates arguing, perhaps the true philosopher, or the true lover of wisdom, needs to pay attention to both.\nDiscussion questions Socrates in the Phaedo claims that the body is an impediment to wisdom. In this piece, we\u0026rsquo;ve seen some arguments against this claim. But is there any respect in which he is correct? How often, in your experience, are \u0026ldquo;gut feelings\u0026rdquo; reliable (if they are reliable)? Are they more, or less, reliable than reasoning things out? Have you ever had a gut feeling that has turned out to be completely, utterly wrong? The Zhuangzi talks about \u0026ldquo;scurrying around while sitting down.\u0026rdquo; What do you think the text means? Do you have any physical, embodied practices of your own that help you in the cultivation of wisdom? (For example, going for walks, meditation, working out, engaging in crafts that involve physical effort). How do these things help? Notes [1] In Plato: Complete Works, edited by John M.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Anaxagoras: Life Anaxagoras was born into a wealthy family around the year 500 BCE in the city of Clazomenae, close to present-day Izmir on the coast of Turkey. When he was around twenty years old, he left Clazomenae for Athens. Accounts of why he moved to Athens differ: but some commentators claim that he left home because he was afraid that wealth and political power would get in the way of his pursuit of knowledge. Diogenes Laërtius, for example, tells the following story:\nIn the end, he retired and studied nature, giving no thought to public affairs. When someone asked him, \u0026ldquo;Have you no care for your country?\u0026rdquo; he replied, \u0026ldquo;Hush, I am very concerned about my country,\u0026rdquo; and he pointed to the heavens.\nLike many of Diogenes Laërtius\u0026rsquo;s stories, this sounds more like fiction than history. But it does highlight Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s huge preoccupation (like many Presocratic philosophers) with astronomy.\nGreat balls of fire It was his astronomical observations that eventually led Anaxagoras into trouble. After moving from Clazomenae, Anaxagoras spent thirty years in Athens. He became friendly with the great general Pericles, and some accounts say he was either the teacher of Socrates or else the teacher of Archelaus, who in turn taught Socrates. And like Socrates, Anaxagoras ended up in trouble with the authorities, tried on counts of impiety.\nThe thing that led to Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s downfall was his contention that the sun was a globe of hot metal larger than the Peloponnese. This claim that the sun was simply a big, hot lump of stuff offended the religious sensibilities of the Athenians as it left no role for gods such as Helios or Apollo.\nFortunately, Anaxagoras was defended at his trial by Pericles. And the general had studied the arts of rhetoric from his formidable partner Aspasia, so was no slouch when it came to making arguments in the philosopher\u0026rsquo;s defence. As a result, Anaxagoras got off lightly, and instead of being sentenced to death like Socrates only faced exile to the city of Lampsacus. He never returned to Athens. But in Lampsacus, he spent his final years honoured by the local people, who erected a statue in his honour. And when he died, in or around the year 428 BCE, the anniversary of his death was made a children\u0026rsquo;s holiday.\nAnaxagoras: Philosophy Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is famously puzzling; and as for many of the Presocratic philosophers, this puzzlement is only increased by the fragmentary nature of his remaining texts. But from these fragments, it is possible to piece together a picture of a strangely distinctive world-view.\nArising and passing away Anaxagoras took on board the claim made by Parmenides that nothing can come from nothing, that in reality nothing in the universe ever comes into existence or passes away out of existence, and that everything in existence is ultimately one single thing. But the problem with this idea is that it seems to be in direct conflict with our experience.\nParmenides got around this by making a distinction between the Way of Truth, the ultimate reality of things, and the Way of Opinion, or how things appear to us. But as a solution, this was not wholly satisfactory. It didn\u0026rsquo;t answer the question of why things appeared to arise and pass away. And this was the question that Anaxagoras tackled head-on.\nA universe of gunk The way Anaxagoras did this was by proposing that before the arising of any specific objects in the universe, there was a kind of primordial mixture out of which things arose. This primordial soup — the philosopher Anna Marmadoro refers to it as \u0026ldquo;gunk\u0026rdquo; — was the ultimate stuff of the universe. It was a goopy kind of blend in which everything was mixed with everything else. And this gunk preceded the existence of any specific thing: planets, platypuses, philosophers and so on. This meant it also preceded any observers who could witness it. Although, given its undifferentiated nature, even if there were observers to poke around in this primordial gunk, there would be nothing to see.\nAll things were together, unlimited both in amount and in smallness, for the small, too, was unlimited.— Anaxagoras, Fragment B1\nAnaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s primordial gunk is a strange kind of thing. Another Presocratic philosopher, Democritus, argued that the things of the universe could be divided up repeatedly until we got to a point where we could no longer divide things any further: in other words, until we reached the uncuttable atoms that make up all things (atom in Greek means \u0026ldquo;uncuttable\u0026rdquo;). But Anaxagoras is not an atomist, and his gunk is not the indivisible bedrock of things. Instead, it is much more dynamic and\u0026hellip; well, messy. You can poke around all you like, and you won\u0026rsquo;t get to the bottom of it.\nWhen things like planets, platypuses and philosophers emerge out of this undifferentiated gunk, Anaxagoras says they are separated off. But in being separated off they do not lose their gunkiness. They continue to contain the seeds of everything that exists, because every bit of existence is mixed up with every other bit. So Anaxagoras says that:\nIn all things, there are many things present, equal in number, both in the greater and in the lesser of the things being separated off.— Anaxagoras, Fragment B6\nFor Anaxagoras, everything is present in everything else. And whatever the scale of a thing, from the smallest to the largest, everything else remains present in it. One way of thinking of this is that everything is a kind of coagulation of the original gunk, but in coagulating, it maintains the extreme mixture of the gunk out of which it has come. Or as Anaxagoras puts it:\nNothing can be completely separate; everything is in everything — Anaxagoras, Fragment B6\nSeparation and Nous This raises a puzzling question: how does this separation out of primordial gunk take place? Or what is the coagulation agent that makes this original gunk start to separate off? Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s replies that it is Nous or \u0026ldquo;mind.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is one of the trickiest parts of Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s philosophy. He insists that Nous is the one thing that escapes his rule that everything is mixed with everything else. Of all things, Nous or mind is the only thing that is \u0026ldquo;unmixed, alone and by itself.\u0026rdquo; And it is this that gives it the ability to \u0026ldquo;set in order\u0026rdquo; the undifferentiated stuff of the universe. Anaxagoras writes that:\nAnd whatever sorts of things were going to be, and whatever sorts were and now are not, and as many as are now and whatever sorts will be, all these Nous set in order\u0026hellip;— Anaxagoras, Fragment B6\nThis may all seem quite perplexing. But Anaxagoras left a significant legacy. Through his theory that sets up an undifferentiated, gunky goop as the material basis of things, with the mind acting as the ordering principle, he puts in place a long-standing metaphysical division: the division between mind and matter. And this division became central to the philosophical traditions that followed him.\nFurther Reading Anaxagoras is a tricky philosopher to get to grips with. But here are a few places to start following up on some of the ideas.\nBooks Anna Marmodoro\u0026rsquo;s Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s Metaphysics (Oxford University Press 2017) has a fascinating discussion of the gunkiness of Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s philosophy.\nA great translation of Anaxagoras\u0026rsquo;s fragments is Anaxagoras of Clazomenae: Fragments and Testimonia: a text and translation with notes and essays by Patricia Curd (University of Toronto Press 2007).\nOnline Resources \u0026ldquo;Gunk\u0026rdquo; is a technical, philosophical term!

            "content": "Socrates and Zhuang Zhou on not knowing Welcome back. In the previous piece, we saw how Aristotle carves up human activity to distinguish between production, chosen action and contemplation. And we looked at the distinction between theoretical wisdom and what Aristotle calls phronesis or practical wisdom. According to Aristotle, we can develop our faculties to become wiser, both in terms of how we think about the world and in terms of how we act.\nBut this time, we\u0026rsquo;re going to ask about the limits of wisdom. We might think that wisdom is a good thing and that we should try to have as much of it as possible. But how practical is the goal of becoming wise? Knowing what we know about human life, is it reasonable to aspire to wisdom? And if so, how much wisdom can we hope for?\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to explore these questions with the help of two very different philosophers: Zhuang Zhou, from the Chinese tradition, and Socrates from the Greek tradition. So let\u0026rsquo;s dive in, and start with Socrates.\nWhat Can We Know? Gods, oracles and human wisdom Socrates is one of history\u0026rsquo;s most maddening, strange and perplexing philosophers. He was born in Athens around 470 BCE. His mother was a midwife and his father was a stonemason, and Socrates may have spent some time working in his father\u0026rsquo;s family business. Socrates was a rough character, famously ugly, both blunt and compelling in speech. And he was driven to philosophy by a strange encounter with the oracle of the god Apollo.\nAccording to the story Socrates tells in Plato\u0026rsquo;s Apology, Socrates\u0026rsquo;s childhood friend Chaerephon once went to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi. The question he put to the oracle was this: was anyone in Athens wiser than Socrates? The oracle confirmed that there was nobody wiser than Socrates. So Chaerephon hurried back to Athens and told Socrates what the god had said. But the philosopher was perplexed by this godly pronouncement.\nWhen I heard of this reply I asked myself: “Whatever does the god mean? What is his riddle? I am very conscious that I am not wise at all; what then does he mean by saying that I am the wisest? For surely he does not lie; it is not legitimate for him to do so.”Plato, Apology 21a [1]\nFor Socrates, the oracle could not be wrong: it was the nature of the gods to be wise. But this left him with a problem. Socrates certainly didn\u0026rsquo;t feel particularly wise. So what was the god up to?\nResolving to get to the bottom of the mystery, Socrates wandered around Athens, collaring passers-by, and cross-examining them about their wisdom (the term for this cross-examination is elenchus: see the Philosopher File on Socrates). He started out by talking to the members of Athens\u0026rsquo;s intellectual elite, and he found that their wisdom seemed to dwindle under cross-examination. Next, he talked to the politicians, and the same thing happened. After this, he talked to the poets and the craftspeople and found they didn\u0026rsquo;t know much either. In this way, it began to dawn on him that human wisdom is in pretty short supply.\nWhat is probable, gentlemen, is that in fact the god is wise and that his oracular response meant that human wisdom is worth little or nothing, and that when he says this man, Socrates, he is using my name as an example, as if he said: “This man among you, mortals, is wisest who, like Socrates, understands that his wisdom is worthless.”Plato, Apology 23b [2]\nSo Socrates concluded that the oracle was perhaps right: nobody knew anything, but Socrates knew he didn\u0026rsquo;t know anything, and so he had some claim to being the wisest in all Athens.\nHowever, Socrates\u0026rsquo;s quest to work out what the oracle was talking about had unfortunate consequences. His cross-examination punctured the self-worth of his fellow-citizens and made him unpopular. Eventually, he was put on trial on charges of impiety and corrupting the youth of the city. Plato\u0026rsquo;s Apology, where this story about the oracle comes from, is an account of his Socrates\u0026rsquo;s defence. And although it is a compelling read, as a defence it was unsuccessful: Socrates was found guilty and executed.\nWhat if the best we can hope for is knowing we don\u0026rsquo;t know? There are different ways of reading Socrates\u0026rsquo;s conclusion. On the one hand, we could read Socrates as meaning that human wisdom is simply very difficult to attain—and if we want to get started on wisdom, we need to recognise that we know nothing. In this view, wisdom starts (as we saw in the first piece in this current series) with the humility of knowing how little we know. Once we have faced up to how shaky and uncertain the foundations of our knowledge, then we can set about developing wisdom.\nThere is, however, a more unsettling reading. What if Socrates is saying that human wisdom is not up to scratch, and can never be up to scratch? What if human wisdom is entirely deficient, and we cannot develop any more wisdom than the knowledge of our ignorance? Where does this leave philosophy, the love of wisdom? Does it undermine the search for wisdom? Or does it leave us starting out again and again, striving for the wisdom we will never attain, treading a path where our progress can be measured only by the continual deepening of our understanding of how very little we know?\nButterflies, dreams and the finitude of knowledge A long way from Athens, a century after Socrates, another philosopher started to raise questions about the deficiencies of human claims to wisdom. That philosopher was Zhuang Zhou.\nZhuang Zhou is said to have lived around the fourth century BCE and is traditionally credited as being the author of the text called \u0026ldquo;Master Zhuang\u0026rdquo; or the Zhuangzi (sometimes also written Chuang Tzu). In this piece, I\u0026rsquo;ll use Zhuang Zhou to refer to the historical individual, and \u0026ldquo;the Zhuangzi\u0026rdquo; to refer to the text that bears his name.\nAs is fitting for a philosopher who is sceptical about what we can know, we don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Zhuang Zhou. The later historian, Sima Qian (c. 145-86 BCE), suggested that came from the small town of Meng in the ancient state of Song, where he held a low-ranking official position. Sima Qian gives another few glimpses of Zhuang Zhou\u0026rsquo;s life, but these all seem to be culled from stories that appear in the Zhuangzi itself.\nAlthough the Zhuangzi is attributed to Zhuang Zhou, scholars have argued it is not a single-authored text so much as a loose anthology of writings, parts of which date back at least to 300 BCE. But although the content of the Zhuangzi is quite varied, the whole book is pervaded by a remarkably unified spirit of rambunctious playfulness. It is a riot of stories, jokes, riddles, digressions and philosophical puzzles that grapple with questions of what we can know, and what value knowledge and wisdom have.\nOne of the most famous stories in the Zhuangzi talks about how Zhuang Zhou fell asleep and dreamed he was a butterfly. The story goes like this:\nOnce Zhuang Zhou dreamt he was a butterfly, fluttering about joyfully just as a butterfly would. He followed his whims exactly as he liked and knew nothing about Zhuang Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, the startled Zhuang Zhou in the flesh. He did not know if Zhou had been dreaming he was a butterfly, or if a butterfly was now dreaming it was Zhou.Zhuangzi: The Essential Writings [3]\nNourishing our lives The Zhuangzi is full of moments of philosophical whimsy like this. But this whimsy is also part of a bigger set of concerns about what it means to be wise, and the limits of human wisdom. Earlier in the same section of the Zhuangzi, you can find is the following passage:\nThe flow of my life is bound by its limits; the mind bent on knowledge, however, never is. If forced to follow something limited by no bounds, the bounded [current of life] is put in danger. And to meet this danger by enhancing knowledge even further—that merely exacerbates the danger. Zhuangzi: The Essential Writings [4]\nIn other words, there are countless things we could know: our hunger for knowledge can go on and on. But ultimately we are finite beings. For the Zhuangzi, the idea that we could attain to some kind of final, ultimate knowledge is a problem not because it is impossible, but because we end up exhausting ourselves in the attempt.\nIn the Zhuangzi, our vitality is something that needs to be nourished and guarded; and the quest for knowledge and wisdom is one of the ways that we can dissipate this vitality. To care for our lives, we need to practice what one contemporary philosopher has called \u0026ldquo;knowledge abstinence\u0026rdquo; [5]. We need to stop chasing after knowledge, recognising that this is an unending and often thankless quest, one that puts our life in danger.\nFom the point of view of the Zhuangzi, the tale of Socrates being put to death is not so much a story of heroic commitment to truth as it is a story of how we stupidly (and thus unwisely) put our lives in danger by our futile commitment to the pursuit of wisdom. The response from the author of the Zhuangzi to Socrates might simply be \u0026ldquo;I told you so!\u0026rdquo; And Socrates\u0026rsquo;s obsession with scuttling around Athens in a quest for wisdom is almost a textbook example of somebody whose inability to abstain from knowledge has led to their destruction.\nThe trouble with ethics But so far, we have only been talking about knowledge. So, where does this leave us with questions of practical wisdom? Because wisdom is not just about what we know; it is also about what we do — think of the unwise friend we met in the first piece in this series who tries to cuddle the gorilla in the zoo. For the Zhuangzi, the pursuit of knowledge is, practically speaking, potentially harmful. And we encountered this idea in the last article on Aristotle, with the story of the philosopher Thales who fell into a well. But the Zhuangzi goes one further to insist that the pursuit of practical wisdom, or the cultivation of virtue, can itself be ruinous.\nIn Ancient China, one of the most enduring ideals was that of the Confucian sage. In Confucianism, the sage or sheng ren was upstanding and upright. They knew how to perform the correct rituals and rites. They understood how music (an important theme for Confucian philosophers) brought about harmony. And they conducted themselves according to humanity and justice (ren yi in Chinese).\nBut the Zhuangzi pokes fun at these paragons of virtue:\nThen along came the sages. Limping and staggering after Humanity, straining on tiptoe after Responsibility, they filled everyone in the world with self-doubt. Lasciviously slobbering over music, fastidiously obsessing over ritual, they got everyone in the world to take sides.Zhuangzi: The Essential Writings [6]\nWe might think that ethics — practical wisdom, or a concern with the goodness of our chosen action — is the solution to our problems. But the Zhuangzi challenges us to consider something shocking. What if it is precisely because of our ethical concerns and commitments that people end up taking sides? What if it is our limping and staggering after virtue that causes division between us?\nWho ate all the cookies? This concern is echoed by Socrates, back over in Greece. In one of Plato\u0026rsquo;s early dialogues, the Euthyphro, Socrates is outside the court-room where he is about to be tried for impiety. He meets a young man, Euthyphro, who is taking his father to court on similar charges. And the two men start debating the question of what is meant by \u0026ldquo;piety.\u0026rdquo;\nDuring the debate, Socrates asks Euthyphro about the roots of our hatred and anger. What are the subjects, he asks, that cause us to get hot under the collar? Certainly not disagreements about things that can be easily measured: nobody would go to war over the question of how many cookies were left in the jar: they would just count the remaining cookies\u0026hellip;\nBut what they might go to war over is the question of who ate all the cookies. This is how Socrates argues the case:\nWhat subject of difference would make us angry and hostile to each other if we were unable to come to a decision? Perhaps you do not have an answer ready, but examine as I tell you whether these subjects are the just and the unjust, the beautiful and the ugly, the good and the bad. Are these not the subjects of difference about which, when we are unable to come to a satisfactory decision, you and I and other men become hostile to each other whenever we do? Plato, Euthyphro (7d) [7]\nCutting wisdom down to size This is a challenging question: what if our concern with ethics is not the solution to our problems, but a part of the problem? If so, then what are we to do? In answering this question, Socrates and the Zhuangzi take slightly different paths. Socrates seems to hold to the idea that ethical knowledge is worth seeking, even if he is not sure we can attain it. And if nothing else, on this quest we might see through the shakiness of our own moral convictions, and find ways to de-escalate the worst of our conflicts.\nBut the Zhuangzi takes an even more radical view. It suggests that when it comes to practical wisdom, we should give up entirely on the idea of becoming exemplary. We should stop trying to be good, and lower the moral bar. Because only when we stop straining after goodness can we nourish our lives, and guard ourselves against the perils of existence.\nFor the Zhuangzi (although not for Socrates), perhaps Mary Oliver\u0026rsquo;s advice in her poem Wild Geese is closest to the mark, as it replaces the search for knowledge and goodness with the art of tending and nourishing our life.\nYou do not have to be good.You do not have to walk on your kneesfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.You only have to let the soft animal of your bodylove what it loves\u0026hellip;\nQuestions Here are some questions to get you thinking about this week\u0026rsquo;s theme\u0026rsquo;s.\nIs Socrates too pessimistic about the possibility of human wisdom? Aren\u0026rsquo;t there things that we can know? Can you think of any examples of times where \u0026ldquo;knowledge abstinence\u0026rdquo; might be a good thing? Or is all knowledge worth having? In what sense does the pursuit of knowledge stand in the way of nourishing our vitality (if it does)? For both the Zhuangzi and Socrates, our concern with ethics can cause all kinds of problems. Does this mean we should, as the Zhuangzi seems to suggest, give up on ethics entirely? Or are there ways of keeping a commitment to ethics, while better managing these problems?

            "tags": ["Interviews",],
            "content": "Introduction Welcome to the first ever Philosopher File interview! In this interview, I\u0026rsquo;m talking to Anna Ezekiel, a philosopher originally from Scotland and now based in Hong Kong. Since 2014, Anna has worked as an independent scholar, living with ME / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. She has a particular interest in German women philosophers.\nAnna\u0026rsquo;s hugely readable and enjoyable translation of Karoline von Günderrode\u0026rsquo;s Poetic Fragments was published by SUNY Press 2016, and she is currently working on a further book of translations by Günderrode called Philosophical Fragments. She is interested in expanding the philosophical canon to include a wider diversity of voices, and to expand our notion of what philosophy is, or what it could be.\n“I believe that the lack of a single, universally agreed-upon definition of what philosophy is or what form it should take is a strength of the philosophical project.\u0026quot; — Anna Ezekiel_, Philosophy and Genre._\nOn expanding philosophy, and independence: Anna Ezekiel Q: Welcome, Anna Ezekiel. I want to start by asking how you got into philosophy, and what drives you to keep on working? I got into philosophy for different reasons than the reasons that drive me now, although there’s a common thread of wanting to expand my ways of thinking about the world. I began with curiosity about how people from different cultures think and act (my BA was in ethics and comparative religion). Then I became fascinated by thinking about language, myth-making and community — topics that I wrote about for my MA and PhD theses.\nBut by the time I finished my PhD I was burnt out. My work felt meaningless, like publishing for the sake of publishing. Then I came across a paper by Christine Battersby about the German philosopher Karoline von Günderrode, and I realised there was a world of philosophical writings by historical women that has never been properly addressed and that could revolutionise how we think about philosophy. But for that to happen, someone needs to do the work of picking apart these women’s writings and explaining the philosophical positions they present.\nIt takes a lot of work to unearth what’s new and valuable in a writer’s texts, and with these women we have to start right from the beginning. So this is what I do. My translations, introductions and articles are intended to help advance our understanding of Günderrode’s thought. I think of my work as part of a joint effort to expand philosophy, not just to include the work of women and other excluded groups, but also to broaden the philosophical exploration of the ways people think and encounter the world.\nQ: You are an independent scholar. What challenges does this represent? And what are the advantages of independence? It’s very challenging working as an independent scholar. The biggest challenge is money. Not only do you have to work freelance — and most philosophical work is not paid, which is one reason why I do so much translation — but you’re also eligible for very few awards, most of which require institutional affiliation. It’s also difficult to get access to texts. Fortunately, various universities let me use their collections, and it’s worth knowing that universities in the UK (for instance) charge a relatively low fee to use their libraries and online resources. At one point, I did a second Master’s degree to obtain library access.\nAnother challenge is that it’s hard to gain recognition as an independent scholar, though this is changing because the academic job market has recently been so terrible that most people in the field are now aware that very good scholars are often unable to get reliable work.\nHowever, I do love the independence. I don’t miss writing funding applications. I’m happy to avoid administrative duties. And I can work on absolutely anything I want. It would have been hard to go on the job market with a project on a lesser-known philosopher like Karoline von Günderrode, but as I wasn’t very interested in finding a university-based job I didn’t have to worry about that. And, as it happens, my work on Günderrode has corresponded with a surge in interest in historical women philosophers. It’s been a privilege to contribute to this movement.\nBut the biggest advantage for me is the flexibility. I have ME/CFS and chronic pain stemming from spinal surgery in 2014, which make a typical academic career impossible. As an independent scholar, I can fit my work around my unreliable body, and I manage to work quite well like that.\nOn free will, death and identity: Karoline von Günderrode Q: Very few English-speaking philosophers have even heard of Günderrode. So who was Günderrode, and why does she matter? Karoline von Günderrode (1780–1806) is often described as a Romantic thinker, and she was an important bridge between earlier and later German Romanticism. She came from a noble family with a passion for literature and philosophy, and until the end of her short life, she retained a thirst for knowledge and for recognition as a writer. Her suicide at the age of twenty-six led to a long-running interest in her biography: there are dozens of novels, plays, poems, paintings and pieces of music about Günderrode. Both her life and her death have often been considered tragic, slightly scandalous, and in keeping with Romantic ideas.\nBut Günderrode\u0026rsquo;s ideas influenced many better-known intellectual figures of her day, as her correspondence suggests. These lines of influence, and Günderrode’s posthumous fame, make it strange that few people have read Günderrode\u0026rsquo;s work seriously as philosophy, at least until recently. But Günderrode presents distinctive and fascinating arguments on gender, free will, identity and consciousness.\nWhen reading Günderrode, and many other women writers of the time, you get a very different perspective on philosophical and literary movements to those perspectives — based entirely on work by men — that have been dominant until now.\nQ: One of the distinctive contributions made by Günderrode is her view of free will. Could you say more about this? Günderrode’s contributions to the debates about free will versus determinism that were raging at the time she wrote are understated, deliberately ambiguous, and nuanced. She explores this topic mainly in her plays, which is a format that allows her to present a variety of viewpoints on the question without committing to any of them.\nThis makes it difficult to say conclusively what she claimed about free will; however, it is clear that she thinks two things are crucial to the question: (1) the impact of social conditions on one’s actions; (2) the impact of one’s actions on the freedom of others. And she suggests that these factors can be obscured when we take an overly abstract approach to free will.\nIn many of her plays, Günderrode puts the question of whether a powerful male character’s actions are free or determined at the front and centre. But around these characters, Günderrode also shows women, servants and others for whom the answer to whether they can act freely is, in one sense, a resounding “no.”\nDespite this, Günderrode shows female characters finding ways to realise their decisions that take account of these constraints placed upon them by other people and external circumstances. Behind the conflict between free will and determinism enacted by the male protagonists in her plays, the female characters reveal a way of acting that is not independent of external events and forces, but also not completely constrained by them.\nQ: In your book, you explore Günderrode’s distinctive and fascinating philosophy of death, which links to a complex set of ideas about selfhood, love, metaphysics, and the mutability of things. What’s going on here? Günderrode’s writings on death have always captured people’s imaginations, especially because of her suicide, but it’s unfortunate that because of this most readers have tended to view her as simply morbid, instead of investigating what she was saying.\nHer ideas about death are slightly unusual and, as you say, closely tied to her metaphysics and her conception of the self. Günderrode’s basic metaphysical picture is that the universe is made up of “elements,” which join together in groups to constitute beings (including human beings) and objects in the world. She claims that when these beings/objects die or are destroyed, the elements are redistributed and then create new entities by joining together with new elements according to “laws of attraction.”\nThis means that, for Günderrode, death is not an ending. Instead, we go on to experience new ways of being — we go through a kind of reincarnation. Not only that, but because for Günderrode beings are constituted by attraction between the elements, death is a union with those we love; and the feeling of love we experience while alive is our sensing of the physical attraction between the elements out of which we and our loved ones are made. Once we die and decompose, the elements are freed to join together with those of our loved ones and form new entities. We won’t just be together with the people we love; we’ll join with them at a fundamental level and become a new being.\nThis also has implications for Günderrode’s claims about consciousness and personal identity. If it’s the case, as she claims, that individuals can be shaken up and divided into parts that then join together with a bunch of parts from other individuals, then who we are can’t be a function of our current consciousness of being an individual human being; we must be able to experience different forms of awareness and have a different sense of ourselves that changes, but survives, as we go through this process.\nIt’s quite a strange and radical understanding of identity.\nQ: The Poetic Fragments contain poems, plays and other kinds of writing that don’t, at first glance, look like philosophy. Is this out of necessity? Or can writing like this accomplish things a more overtly philosophical style can’t? It\u0026rsquo;s true that the constraints of being a woman in the early 19th century restricted the ways in which Günderrode could write. But there are also good reasons inherent to her subject-matter that make literary forms a useful means of communicating. I mentioned above that Günderrode uses her dramas to convey several viewpoints on the question of freedom and power: drama is a good format for this, as it allows an exploration of the implications of different approaches to the human desire to be free while retaining a certain agnosticism and humility about which of these is correct.\nGünderrode also uses literary forms to think through and communicate what the implications of her metaphysical claims are for our experience. For instance, she explains her metaphysical views about the elements in her more academic, essay-like writing. Then in her literary pieces, she shows individuals experiencing this pull between some of their own elements and those of another person — experiences of love, connection, or friendship.\nAnother example is in relation to Günderrode’s understanding of personal identity and death. In several of her pieces, including “An Apocalyptic Fragment” and “A Dream,” she uses a literary style to try to convey this non-conscious awareness or selfhood that continues after death. Literature is better than dry academic writing at helping us imagine what it might be like to exist in a way that is not circumscribed by purely human perspectives and experiences. Since Günderrode is presenting a model of identity and consciousness or awareness that is very unconventional and different to how we usually understand ourselves, using evocative language can help us imagine things differently to how we tend to understand them on the basis of our usual categories.\nQ: I\u0026rsquo;m always interested in this question of style. Plato wrote in dialogue form. Parmenides wrote in verse, as did Lucretius. Günderrode wrote plays. Are you ever frustrated by the style constraints in academic philosophy? On a personal level, I find an academic style of writing philosophy quite comfortable: it seems to suit my style of thinking and communicating to write in a structured, logical, very literal way.\nBut what is frustrating is that this is often seen as the standard for presenting all philosophical thought, and I don’t think it’s necessarily the best for all philosophical explorations, all individual philosophers or all audiences. Just because philosophy can be done in that way, and just because that’s what we all tend to be trained in, doesn’t mean it’s the only or the best way to do it. It would be nice not to have to preface every investigation of a piece of non-academic writing with a painstaking argument for why it should be taken seriously by philosophers.\nConclusion Q: What’s next on the horizon for you and your work? I’m finishing up a volume of translations of what I consider Günderrode’s most philosophically interesting pieces, titled Philosophical Fragments, for Oxford University Press. __ I’m guest blogging monthly on historical German women philosophers for the Genealogies of Modernity project, and I’ve started my own blog on historical women philosophers and philosophical genres. I also have six or seven articles and book chapters on Günderrode that I’m committed to. But after the end of 2021, I’d like to move on to work on other historical German women philosophers. In particular, Günderrode’s friend Bettina Brentano-von Arnim has some radical things to say about philosophy and music, and someone needs to begin a systematic exposition of the philosophical contributions in Rahel Varnhagen’s letters.\nQ: Finally, if you could give any advice to an aspiring philosopher, what would it be? Find your people: Develop professional relationships with philosophers and other scholars, within philosophy departments or outside them, people you enjoy working with, who build you up, who are interested in your work, and who are working on things that excite you.\nQ: Thank you, Anna Ezekiel!

            "content": "Wisdom, thinking and doing Welcome to the second piece in this series on wisdom: what it is and why it matters. In this piece, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be plunging into the work of Aristotle, one of Ancient Greece\u0026rsquo;s most profound thinkers, to ask about the relationship between wisdom, thinking and doing.\nWisdom, as we saw in the last essay, is more complex than it first seems. When we say someone is wise, we are not saying they possess just a single quality. Instead, we are suggesting they possess a suite of qualities. To be wise involves, at the very least, some combination of how you think about the world, how skilfully you act, and how effectively you communicate.\nIn this article, we\u0026rsquo;re going to look more closely at how Aristotle distinguishes between two of these things: the wisdom that is rooted in our knowledge or understanding (or theoretical wisdom), and the wisdom that is rooted in our action (or practical wisdom).\nAristotle: philosopher of everything Aristotle was born in Stagira in Macedonia in the year 384 BCE. He later moved to Athens where he studied with Plato. According to the biographer Diogenes Laërtius, Aristotle was quite an oddball. He had small eyes and bow legs, and he spoke with a lisp. He was a pretty snappy dresser: he trimmed his hair short — although the fashion at the time was to have long, flowing locks — and he liked to wear big, elaborate rings on his fingers. And it was said that he was an electrifying public speaker.\nAristotle is one of those philosophers who can feel daunting because he was interested in pretty much everything. He wrote about poetry and politics, about ethics and the nature of the soul. He did research into biology. He interviewed beekeepers to find out about bees, and sponge divers to find out about sponges. He spoke to hunters to find out about wild animals. And he carried out numerous dissections of animals to see how they worked.\nThis habit of taking things apart to see how they work was something that characterised all of Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s philosophy. He was obsessed with the idea of systematically studying the nature of things, whatever those things were. So whether he was writing about politics or poetry, ethics or zoology, his approach to problems was to first try and break them down into their constituent parts. And when it came to wisdom, he did the same.\nBreaking action apart In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle explores the question of what it means for a human being to live a good life. What is central to Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view of the good life (or, in fact, to any life at all), is the idea that living is an activity. Life is not just a matter of being alive. Instead, it is something we engage in actively.\nLife is a kind of activity, and each person engages in activity in relation to those objects and with those faculties that he likes best; the musician, for example, engages in activity with his hearing in relation to songs, the student with his thought in relation to what he studies, and so on in each case.Nicomachean Ethics, 1175a [1]\nBut if life is a kind of activity, what does it mean to act?\nAristotle breaks down human action into three broad categories. The first is theoria, or contemplation. This is about our knowledge of the world, and our active seeking to understand the world and make sense of it. The second is poiēsis, which literally means \u0026ldquo;production\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;bringing forth\u0026rdquo;, and is related to the word \u0026ldquo;poetry\u0026rdquo;: this is about how we produce or bring forth particular things through the use of particular skills. And the third is praxis, or \u0026ldquo;chosen action.\u0026rdquo; Praxis is about how we choose to act as we make our way through the world.\nYou can think of these three kinds of action, more or less, as thinking, making and doing: an example of theoria (or thinking) is getting to grips with Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s philosophy and exploring the truth or falsity of it; an example of poiēsis (or making) is baking a pie; and an example of praxis (or doing) is choosing how to deal with an ethically difficult situation at work.\nThinking, making and doing We are used to drawing a distinction between theory and practice, or between thinking and doing. But Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s threefold distinction between thinking, making and doing may feel unfamiliar. After all, isn\u0026rsquo;t making a kind of doing? Here we need to do a bit more unpacking.\nTo understand the distinction Aristotle is making, and to understand more precisely what Aristotle means by praxis, we need to ask what these different kinds of action are for. Every chosen activity, Aristotle says, is for the sake of something. Theoria (thinking or contemplation) aims at something that is beyond the activity itself: we contemplate for the sake of truth or understanding. Poiēsis also aims at something beyond the activity itself: we make an apple pie not just for the fun of it, but also for the sake of having an apple pie. But praxis, or \u0026ldquo;chosen action\u0026rdquo;, is different because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t aim at something beyond the activity itself. The activity is the point. You act well for the sake of acting well, not for some further purpose. And is what makes praxis so distinctive: the end or purpose of the activity is the activity itself.\nPhilosophical slapstick, and the perils of contemplation So for Aristotle, we need to think about wisdom in relation to these different kinds of human activity. Wisdom is not just theoretical. It is not just about knowing stuff. There is also a kind of wisdom in making stuff, which we might call skill. And there is wisdom in how we choose how to act, which Aristotle calls practical wisdom or phronesis.\nFor Aristotle, practical wisdom is an essential part of a well-lived life. This is why he berates the earlier philosopher Thales who, in a famous moment of philosophical slapstick, is said to have fallen down a well when looking up at the stars. Thales might have been pretty smart in some respects, but failing to look where you are putting your feet is foolish. People like Thales, Aristotle comments drily, may know lots of stuff, but they lack practical wisdom and are \u0026ldquo;ignorant of what is in their own interest\u0026rdquo; (1141b) [2]. Thales is like the original distracted professor, who is so immersed in contemplation that he fails at the practical business of living—to the extent that it puts his life in danger.\nAnd here, Aristotle makes a fascinating distinction between theoretical and practical wisdom. Theoretical wisdom is about general principles, or the knowledge of things that are stable and unchanging. But practically speaking, our lives are not like this: our day-to-day existences are much more unruly and changeable. So in the hurly-burly of our everyday lives, when choosing how to act, we can\u0026rsquo;t rely only on a single theory or body of to tell us how to act. Instead, we need a kind of wisdom that can get to grips with uncertainty and change:\nAgents must always look at what is appropriate in each case as it happens, as do doctors and navigators. — Nicomachean Ethics, 1104a [3]\nPractical wisdom as navigation This idea of practical wisdom as a kind of navigation is a fascinating one. Imagine that you want to cross the Atlantic, so you go down to the docks to see who is around. You meet two navigators, both of whom are looking for crew. Let\u0026rsquo;s call them Maisie and Mildred. You get talking to them, trying to decide whom to travel with.\nFirst, you speak with Maisie. It turns out she has impressive credentials. She is a whizz at theory. She has gone to navigator school and even taken a PhD in navigation science from a prestigious university. In fact, she has studied pretty much everything a navigator might need: engineering, meteorology, shipbuilding, fluid mechanics, astronomy and so on. Her boat, the Theoria, is gleaming and new, state of the art. There\u0026rsquo;s only one down-side: when you chat to Maisie, you casually ask her how many times she has made this voyage. \u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; she says with a brilliant smile, \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t. It\u0026rsquo;s my first trip. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;ve never been on a boat before in my life\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nYou thank Maisie and go and talk to Mildred. She is standing by her boat, the Praxis. It __ seems solid enough, but it is not nearly so shiny as the Theoria. And when you get chatting, Mildred turns out to be a very different kind of navigator. She has no degree and very little schooling. In fact, at the age of thirteen, she bunked off school altogether, stole a neighbour\u0026rsquo;s boat (the neighbour later forgave her), took it for a couple of spins around the harbour, then sailed it up the coast. After that, she never came home. Mildred is now fifty years old, she tells you, and she has sailed around the world eight times, as well as crossed the Atlantic more times than she can count. This is promising, but Mildred also seems a little strange. When she talks, she lapses into long digressions, telling you salty sea-dog tales about mermaids and whales and spells that quell tempests, things that don\u0026rsquo;t sound much like accurate theory\u0026hellip;\nThe question is this: whom do you choose to take you across the Atlantic? The theoretically astute Maisie? Or the practically experienced Mildred?\nWisdom in theory and in practice I don\u0026rsquo;t know about you, but my money would be on Mildred, however many impressive degrees and qualifications Maisie has, and however weird some of Mildred\u0026rsquo;s theoretical positions. Because when it comes to knowing how to act, or how to navigate our way through the world, theoretical wisdom is not the most important thing. What is most important is developing a living responsiveness to the changing situations we find ourselves in, a keen attention to the changing winds and tides, and the ability to make just the right choices at just the right time.\nFor Aristotle, these two kinds of wisdom — the theoretical and the practical — are very different. When choosing how to act, we can\u0026rsquo;t just take our theories, plonk them down and hope that everything will come out right. Practical wisdom is not the application of general truths to specific circumstances. Instead, it is something entirely different: a knowledge of how to act based on a depth of experience, and on the cultivation of particular dispositions. This is one reason why contemporary philosopher Sophie Grace Chappell (who I\u0026rsquo;ll be interviewing for Looking for Wisdom in a few weeks\u0026rsquo; time) argues that systematic moral theories eventually fail: the application of general principles to specific situations is simply not a good way of choosing how to act wisely.[4]\nWise action involves knowing how to act just now, in this complex unrepeatable situation. Think is the friend who knows just the right thing to say to ease our unhappiness. Or think of the person (and perhaps we all know someone like this) who seems to have an almost magical power to resolve intractable interpersonal disputes. Or think of a hostage negotiator who manages to defuse a complex situation. Knowing how to act is not about the dry business of applying theories to our practical lives. It is the art of developing navigational skill and cultivating the right set of virtues and dispositions so that, when it comes down to it, we will act wisely, whatever circumstance we find ourselves in.\nVirtue and contemplation By now, it might sound as if Aristotle is arguing that practical wisdom is the only wisdom that matters. And this is a common contemporary view. If theory matters at all, we sometimes think, it matters because of how we can put it into practice. Otherwise, it has no use at all. You might not want Maisie as captain. But put both navigators on the same ship, and Maisie\u0026rsquo;s PhD-level theoretical expertise could usefully inform Mildred\u0026rsquo;s practical experience, and offset some of Mildred\u0026rsquo;s more wildly extravagant views about mermaids.\nBut Aristotle doesn\u0026rsquo;t elevate practice above theory like this, nor does he justify theory in terms of its practical value. Instead, he takes the opposite path. He argues that practical wisdom, and the cultivation of virtue, are important because without them, we cannot fully be in a position to engage in contemplation. Practical wisdom is a central to what it means to live a healthful, flourishing life. And the ultimate aim of a healthful, flourishing life is theoria: it is to engage in contemplation. Because for Aristotle, there is no better life than one of contemplation.\nDiscussion questions An easy question to start: Maisie or Mildred? Who would you go with? And why? For Aristotle, practical wisdom is about particular circumstances, and theoretical wisdom is about general principles. But can the two be divided up so easily? Or does theoretical wisdom also matter for how we choose to act? We tend to think that the point of theory is that it should be put into practice. But Aristotle argues the opposite: for him, the point of practice is to provide a strong foundation to our lives, so that we can engage in contemplation. Is there something in what he is saying here? Do you know anybody like Thales who has a lot of theoretical wisdom, but very little practical wisdom? And do you know anybody who is the opposite: they have a lot of practical wisdom (they seem to always know how to act) even if they lack theoretical wisdom? If so, whose life seems to go more smoothly? Who seems to be flourishing more? Notes [1] Aristotle: Nicomachean Ethics, trans.

            "title": "Xenophanes on Gods and Horses",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Xenophanes (c. 570 BCE — c. 478 BCE) came from the Ionian city of Colophon. He was a poet, a philosopher and an itinerant wanderer, who roamed around Ancient Greece from city to city, and sung his verses like a philosophical busker.\nWe don\u0026rsquo;t know a lot for certain about Xenophanes\u0026rsquo;s long life. He is said to have been teacher to the philosopher Parmenides. He may have been sold into slavery, and later released. Somewhere along the way, he seems to have had two sons, both of whom he outlived (and whom, one text says, \u0026ldquo;he buried with his own hands\u0026rdquo;). And in one of the remaining fragments of his work, Xenophanes says he spent sixty-seven years wandering Greece, and before that twenty-five years living in Colophon, which — if it is correct — means that at the time of writing these words, he was around ninety-two.\nThe wandering critic We know more about Xenophanes\u0026rsquo;s personality than we do about his biography. The fragments of Xenophanes\u0026rsquo;s philosophy that remain suggest he was a strong character. He was deeply concerned with questions of morality. He disliked extravagance and overindulgence, although he admired those who could drink alcohol without losing their virtue (something Socrates later exemplified). He was preoccupied with the politics of his homeland of Colophon, and critical of the people of Colophon for their love of luxury, complaining that they went to the marketplace wearing extravagant clothes and \u0026ldquo;gorgeous long-flowing hair.\u0026rdquo; And he was scornful of the religious thinking of his day.\nPhilosophy Later philosophers didn\u0026rsquo;t treat Xenophanes kindly. Neither Plato nor Aristotle was particularly impressed by him. Nevertheless, what remains of his work suggests the keen and critical intelligence of a thinker with a wide range of interests. And Xenophanes is still famous for his arguments about the nature of the gods and his criticism of anthropomorphism in religion.\nTroublesome gods For Xenophanes, there was a paradox in how his contemporaries regarded the gods. On the surface of it, the Greek gods seem pretty reprehensible characters.\nHomer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods all sorts of things which are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual deceit.— Fragment 11\nBut at the same time, Xenophanes noted that his contemporaries revered the gods. They held them up as exemplars and as protectors of virtue. Take, for example, this evocation of Zeus from Hesiod\u0026rsquo;s Theogony.\nAs one who can distinguish with straight justice what should be;And he in the assembly hall,who speaks unerringly,Even has expertise to quell great quarrels in good season.— Hesiod, Theogony 85\nThe contradiction is obvious. On the one hand, we make the gods in our image to the extent that they exhibit the worst forms of human behaviour. But on the other hand, we praise the gods for their unwavering and exemplary behaviour. What can be done with this contradiction?\nWe could dismiss both the gods and the praise of the gods. Or we could maintain the gods, but resign ourselves to living in a world where the gods are reprehensible. We could shrug, roll our eyes, and say, \u0026ldquo;What can you do? They\u0026rsquo;re gods, after all\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; But Xenophanes prefers a third option. It is, he says, \u0026ldquo;good always to hold the gods in high regard\u0026rdquo; (Fragment 1). And so to maintain both an idea of the gods (or god), and the idea that the gods are virtuous, we have to rethink what it means to be a god.\nOn gods and horses Xenophanes sets his sights on our tendency to anthropomorphise the gods. In a famous argument, Xenophanes points out that:\nBut if horses or oxen or lions had handsor could draw with their hands and accomplish such works as men,horses would draw the figures of the gods as similar to horses, and the oxen as similar to oxen,and they would make the bodiesof the sort which each of them had.— Fragment 15\nNot in our image? Not only does Xenophanes criticise our tendency to identify the gods with our worst traits, but — with keen insight — he also criticises the way that we make gods in our image. And this brings him to a claim about the gods that, in the context of his time, was remarkably novel:\nOne god is greatest among gods and men,not at all like mortals in body or in thought.— Fragment 23\nMany readers have taken this as a claim for monotheism, and some later Christian readers have certainly read the passage like this. But the text itself is uncertain. Does Xenophanes mean that there is a god who has three attributes: being single (\u0026ldquo;one\u0026rdquo;), being great, and being unlike us? Or is he making the more modest claim that there is one particular god (among all the others) who has two attributes: they are the greatest, and they are unlike us?\nKnowledge and true belief In another tantalising fragment, Xenophanes appears to draw a distinction that becomes important to the later philosophical tradition: the distinction between true belief and knowledge. This is what he says:\n… and of course the clear and certain truth no man has seennor will there be anyone who knows about the gods and what I say about all things.For even if, in the best case, one happened to speak just of what has been brought to pass,still he himself would not know. But opinion is allotted to all.— Fragment 34\nWhat Xenophanes seems to be saying is this: we all have opinions, and opinions come pretty cheap. If you give me a few seconds, I can probably come up with an opinion on anything at all. It might even happen that some of my opinions hit the mark. But even if they do hit the mark, this fortunate conjunction of my opinion with the reality of things does not add up to knowledge.\nThis caused some later philosophers, like the sceptic philosopher Sextus Empiricus (c. 160 – 210 CE), to claim that Xenophanes was arguing for the impossibility of true knowledge. Sextus may be overstating the case; but the distinction between opinion and \u0026ldquo;clear and certain truth\u0026rdquo; is a theme that recurs with the philosopher Parmenides, who takes up the challenge of distinguishing between the path of knowledge, and the path of mere opinion.\nFurther Reading Books One excellent, readable translation (the one I use here) is Xenophanes of Colophon: Fragments. A Text and Translation with a Commentary, edited by J.H. Lesher (University of Toronto Press 1992).\nThere are quite a few translations of Hesiod. I\u0026rsquo;ve used Catherine M. Schlegel and Henry Weinfield\u0026rsquo;s version (University of Michigan Press 2006)\nOnline Resources There\u0026rsquo;s a brief and entertaining video on Xenophanes from Foxwede History here.\nImage: The Feast of the Gods, begun c. 1514 by Giovanni Bellini, and completed by Titian in 1529; oil on canvas; National Gallery of Art, Washington.

            "title": "What is Wisdom? (Wisdom #1)",
            "tags": ["Series",],
            "content": "Welcome This is the first in a seven-part series on wisdom. Over this series of articles, we\u0026rsquo;re going to be asking what wisdom is (if it is anything at all), how it matters (if it matters), and how to cultivate it (if it is the kind of thing you can cultivate).\nIn an everyday sense, we seem to have a pretty good grasp of what we mean when we talk about wisdom. When we see somebody clambering over the barrier in the zoo to cuddle the gorilla, we think, “That seems remarkably unwise.” When we go through a difficult relationship breakdown, and we talk with a friend who gives us sound advice, we think, “I\u0026rsquo;m fortunate to have wise friends.”\nBut when it comes to asking what wisdom really is, things get a bit trickier. Wisdom seems to be both the most everyday thing, and also the most elevated.\nLove and humility As is well-known, philosophy or philosophia (φιλοσοφία in Greek) is the love (philo) of wisdom (sophia). This is an idea that goes back to the ancient Greek philosopher Pythagoras. And since Pythagoras, philosophers have claimed to have a particularly close relationship with wisdom. This is a view that continues to persist however many misguided or foolish things philosophers do.\nIn their defence, when philosophers claim to love wisdom, they are not necessarily claiming to be wise. Instead, they are claiming that wisdom is something they cherish, and something to which they aspire.\nFor the shadowy Greek priestess and philosopher Diotima, who was said to have been a teacher to Socrates, love is an intermediary or a go-between (the word used is metaxy). This means that lovers of wisdom exist in a kind of in-between position. In the Symposium, Socrates describes how Diotima taught him that lovers of wisdom are neither wise nor ignorant, but instead “fall in between those two extremes.”\nIn other words, philosophers are no different from the rest of us: they are somewhere between wisdom and ignorance. But what philosophy aims to do, at least in some accounts, is to face up to our lack of wisdom, and to help us move from ignorance to greater wisdom. Socrates, who was famously the wisest person in Athens, claimed he was wise only to the extent that he knew how much he did not know. The beginning of wisdom is seeing into quite how unwise we are.\nThis is why wisdom is sometimes paired with the idea of humility. As T.S. Eliot puts it in the Four Quartets, “The only wisdom we can hope to acquire / Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.” This pairing of wisdom and humility seems to accord with our experience of those people we consider wise, even if it does not always accord with any experience we might have of philosophers. [1]\nDefining wisdom: seeing, skill and speech But what is this thing called wisdom? The word “wisdom” in English comes from the ancient Proto-Indo-European root weid (the asterisk is there to show that this word is a reconstruction), which means “to see.” And this idea of wisdom as involving clear-sightedness is one that recurs in other traditions as well. The word “wisdom” is a distant cousin of the Sanskrit vidyā or “knowledge.”\nAs for the Greek sophia, it is related more closely to the idea of skill, whether in handicrafts, in the arts, in medicine, in divination or in music. Sophia is both knowledge and know-how.\nIn Chinese, particularly in Confucian traditions, the emphasis is more interpersonal. The word that is usually translated as wisdom is zhi (智), which has two components. One of these components, zhi (知), means something like “knowledge.” But the other, yue (曰) means “to speak.” Traditional etymological dictionaries say the original meaning of zhi (智) was to read a scroll out loud, thereby imparting its meaning to others. So zhi is not just something you have individually, but something you engage in interpersonally.\nSo here there are quite a few things that seem to have at least some connection to wisdom: clear-sightedness, skill in managing our lives and navigating the world, and the ability to communicate the understanding we have to others.\nA contemporary starting point But let\u0026rsquo;s try to boil this down to something more concrete. In his 1987 essay, “What is Wisdom, and Why Do Philosophers Love it So?”, Robert Nozick gives the following definition of wisdom:\nWisdom is what you need to under­stand in order to live well and cope with the central problems and avoid the dangers in the predicament(s) human beings find themselves in. [2]\nFor Nozick, wisdom brings together both understanding, and the ability to live well (whatever that means). And this inevitably involves a certain skill in avoiding the kinds of scrapes that human beings often get themselves into: like clambering over that wall to cuddle the gorilla.\nBodies and emotions But this might still seem a bit top-down, as if wisdom is about applying disembodied knowledge to the mess of our lives. This may be one aspect of wisdom, but it is not the only one. Very often, wisdom doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel quite as top-down as this. It feels more intuitive, more immediate and (for want of a better word) squishier. It feels like something that is embodied, more rooted in the emotions, in our physicality and our living responsiveness to our environment.\nOne philosopher who appreciated this squishiness was Friedrich Nietzsche, who lived a troubled and turbulent life in the second half of the nineteenth century. Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s relatively short life — he died at the age of 55, in the year 1900 — was plagued by sickness. In his mid-forties, after a mental and physical collapse, Nietzsche succumbed to mental illness and never recovered. And it is perhaps not surprising that it should take a philosopher so afflicted by ill health to recognise how the body and the mind are so very closely related.\nIn what is perhaps his most famous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche writes about the long-standing tradition in Western philosophy that puts the soul or the mind (psyche in Greek) on a pedestal, and that overlooks the body. “Body am I through and through, and nothing besides,” he writes. “And soul is just a word for something on the body.”\nThen he writes:\nThe body is a great reason, a multiplicity with one sense, a war and a peace, one herd and one shepherd. Your small reason, what you call “spirit” is also a tool of your body\u0026hellip; a small work, and play-thing of your great reason. [3]\nNietzsche wants us to take the body seriously, to understand that wisdom is not something you think your way to, but something that is expressed through the fulness of our physical, embodied being. “There is more reason in your body,” Nietzsche writes, “than in your best wisdom.”\nPutting it all together So when we are looking for wisdom, what is it we are looking for? We\u0026rsquo;re looking for something both ordinary and elusive. We\u0026rsquo;re looking for something that involves understanding, clear perception and navigational skill. We\u0026rsquo;re looking for something that helps us steer away from falling into the worst kind of scrapes. And we\u0026rsquo;re looking for something that involves our minds, but that also involves our emotions and our bodies.\nThis is a loose and baggy idea of wisdom, but it is a starting point. Over the rest of this series, we\u0026rsquo;ll be looking at it more deeply, and drawing on a wide range of philosophers and philosophical traditions to make new inroads into the question of what wisdom is, and how we might live wiser, better lives.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in this series? Here\u0026rsquo;s the outline:\nPart 1: What is wisdom? Part 2: Knowing and doing. Navigating wisdom with Aristotle. Part 3: The limits of wisdom. Socrates and Zhuangzi. Part 4: That gut feeling. Wisdom, the emotions and the body. Part 5: Nurturing the sprouts: Wisdom and cultivation. Part 6: The opposite of wisdom? Thinking about foolishness. Part 7: A science of wisdom? Questions Here are some questions to get you thinking about this week\u0026rsquo;s themes. If you are a member, dive into the comments, and let\u0026rsquo;s chat.\nIs there anybody you know who you would consider genuinely wise? If there are any people who you know to be genuinely wise, then how do you know they are wise? What are the three qualities you most associate with wisdom? Have you ever surprised yourself by acting uncharacteristically wisely? Or, for that matter, have you ever surprised yourself by acting uncharacteristically foolishly?

            "title": "Jing Jiang on Politics, Gender and Weaving",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Far-ranging wisdom Jing Jiang was a Chinese philosopher who was born in the state of Lu around 540 BCE. She appears in the Discourses of the States, or Guoyu, a text that dates to between the fifth and fourth centuries BCE. She is also featured in the later Biographies of Exemplary Women or Lienü Zhuang, an anthology compiled in by the scholar Liu Xiang who lived between 77 BCE and 6 BCE.\nJing Jiang was the wife of Gongfu Mubo, a high-ranking official in Lu. Predeceased by her husband, she raised their son, Gongfu Wenbo, alone. In both the Guoyu and the Lienü Zhuang, she can be found instructing her son on a wide range of matters: from ritual, to the virtues of hard work, to politics.\nThis instruction is not just something she does while the somewhat wayward Wenbo is growing up. Even after Wenbo has risen to become a rather hapless minister in Lu, Jing Jiang is on hand to put him right.\nWrangling Wenbo The Biographies of Exemplary Women describes how as a young man, Wenbo leaves home to study. When he returns, he thinks he is all grown up. He hangs around with a bunch of friends, all young ruffians like himself, and all of whom look up to him because of his superior rank.\nJing Jiang realises her son is not going to make much of himself by carrying on like this, so she takes him to task. She tells him to hang out instead with those who are older and wiser, people he __ can look up to. The text continues:\nAfter this he chose strict teachers and worthy friends to serve him. Those with whom he lived and socialized were all very elderly, toothless gentlemen with yellowed hair. Wenbo would adjust the lapels of their robes, roll up their sleeves for them, and personally serve them food. — Biographies of Exemplary Women, p. 12\nOnly now does Jing Jiang recognise that her son is “now a grown man.” Only now can he start to develop his the fulness of his human capacity, having apprenticed himself, in all humility, to exemplary models.\nPhilosophy In one text, Confucius, China\u0026rsquo;s most famous sage, praises Jing Jiang for her knowledge of ritual and her exemplary conduct. The Biographies of Exemplary Women call her a woman who is “far-ranging in her wisdom and [who] understood the rites.”\nBut as the scholar Lisa Raphals has argued, Confucius\u0026rsquo;s praise only goes so far: he praises her for her knowledge, and for her ability to cultivate the qualities of her son; but he does not give her credit for her own self-cultivation. Jing Jiang may be virtuous and cultivated, but Confucius is uninterested in this. For Confucius at least, her virtue is only of interest to the extent that it impacts upon the hapless Wenbo.\nPolitics, weaving and gender: Nevertheless, Jing Jiang is interesting precisely because of the force of her arguments, which are effective and carefully woven, and which find ways round the gendered expectations of her time.\nThe most famous example of this is the advice she gives Wenbo after he has become a minister. He is clearly doing a poor job and Jing Jiang decides to speak with him. But in the patriarchal culture of Ancient China women were not judged (by men at least) to have any expertise in politics. So this presents Jing Jiang with a problem.\nTo get round this problem, she starts by making an analogy: politics, she says, is like weaving. Wenbo does not contest this analogy, and he is happy to accept it as the premise of his mother\u0026rsquo;s argument.\nOnce Wenbo has accepted this premise, the way cleared for her Jing Jiang instruct her son in politics.\nJing Jiang is cunning. She is aware it is taken for granted within her social context that women have expertise in the art of weaving, just as it is taken for granted that men should be considered experts in the art of politics. So having made an analogy between the two, she is free to talk about politics whilst relying on her own independent sphere of expertise, which is weaving.\nWeaving the net of argument In this way, Jing Jiang starts to weave the net of her argument. She begins by arguing that the different parts of the loom and the cloth correspond to the different parts of the apparatus of the state.\nWhen Wenbo served as minister in Lu, Jing Jiang told him, “I will tell you how the essentials of ruling a country can be found in [the art of weaving]: everything depends upon the warp! The selvage is the means by which the crooked is made straight. It must be strong. The selvage can therefore be thought of as the general. The reed is the means by which one makes uniform what is irregular and brings into line the unruly. Therefore the reed can be thought of as the director [\u0026hellip;]\u0026quot;— Biographies of Exemplary Women p. 13, translation modified.\nThe character for “warp” is jing (經). It can also mean a standard or a rule. By the time the biographies of Jing Jiang were written, it was also the character used to refer to the classic texts that formed the core of Confucian learning. In other words, when it comes to statecraft, everything depends on the warp: on regularity, on standards, and on learning.\nAs her argument proceeds, Jing Jiang sets out the requirements of effective government. A state needs regularity and structure: politics is about keeping the warp and weft of society in order. But effective government also depends upon a well-made loom. In other words, an effective political system is one where all the parts perform their correct functions, and where the ministers and officials are reliable and upright.\nAt the end of the argument, Wenbo now understands more about politics than before. The passage ends with him acknowledging his mother\u0026rsquo;s superior knowledge.\nWenbo bowed twice and received her teaching.— (ibid.)\nWeaving as political philosophy The story in the Biographies of Exemplary Women acknowledges Jing Jiang as a knowledgable and competent advisor in what was, in Ancient China, the traditionally male domain of politics.\nBut what makes the story of Jing Jiang even more fascinating is the skill with which she weaves her argument. She systematically uses the analogy between weaving and politics to illuminate some important and salient features of good government. It is interesting here to compare Jing Jiang with Gārgī Vācaknavī in India, who also used metaphors of weaving to gain authority in philosophical debate.\nFinally, the approach she takes to weaving her arguments shows that Jing Jiang has a clear grasp on the problems faced in a patriarchal society by women thinkers seeking to contribute to philosophical debate. And she has the skill in rhetoric and debate to see the analogy through, and press her point home.\nTaken together, these things make her a political philosopher to be reckoned with.\nFurther Reading Books You can read the Lienü zhuan of Liu Xiang in Anne Behnke Kinney\u0026rsquo;s translation, Exemplary Women of Early China (Columbia University Press, 2014)\nIf you can get hold of it, try \u0026lsquo;A Woman Who Understood the Rites\u0026rsquo; by Lisa Raphals, in Bryan van Norden\u0026rsquo;s Confucius and the Analects: New Essays (Oxford University Press 2002).\nAgain, if you can get hold of it, try \u0026lsquo;Arguments by Women in Early Chinese Texts\u0026rsquo;, also by Lisa Raphals, published in Nan Nü volume 3, issue 2 (2001), pp. 157-195.

            "title": "Parmenides on Truth and Opinion",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Parmenides was a philosopher from the city of Elea, a Greek colony on the Italian peninsula. He was born some time around 515 BCE into a wealthy family. It was said that he had a sharp legal mind, and he was responsible for drawing up the laws of the city. He may also have been a student of the philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon, although this is disputed; and there is evidence he was influenced by the Pythagorean philosophers.\nOther than this, we have very little reliable biographical information on Parmenides. Nevertheless, the single work he authored has had a profound influence on the traditions of philosophy that find their origins in Ancient Greece.\nThe poet-philosopher Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s single philosophical work was called On Nature, although it is likely that the title was given to the work long after its completion. As a work of philosophy, On Nature is unusual in that it is written in the form of a poem. Although this is not unique: much later, the philosopher Lucretius (c. 99 – 55 BCE) would also write an epic philosophical treatise on nature through the medium of verse.\nParmenides\u0026rsquo;s poem is famously difficult to interpret; and this difficulty is compounded by the fact that of the original eight hundred verses, only just under one hundred and sixty lines have survived. Of the lines that survive, some are so fragmentary that they consist only of a single word; and the complete work is one that scholars have patchworked together from a wide range of later sources.\nPhilosophy Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s poem is divided into three parts. The first is a proem, or a preamble. This is followed by two further sections, one called \u0026lsquo;The Way of Truth\u0026rsquo;, and one called \u0026lsquo;The Way of Opinion.\u0026rsquo; Most of the preamble and a substantial chunk of the Way of Truth have survived; meanwhile, many of the Way of Opinion sections have been lost (clearly later philosophers were much more concerned with preserving truths than opinions!).\nCelestial journeys The opening preamble is very strange indeed. In it, Parmenides recounts a mystical journey on a flying chariot, accompanied by the daughters of the sun, where he passes through the \u0026lsquo;gate of the paths of night and day\u0026rsquo; to meet with a goddess, (whom some scholars identify as the Nyx, goddess of the Night).\nThe following extract describes his journey in mystical, almost ecstatic terms:\nThe axle in the axle-box roared from its socket as it blazed — for it was driven on by two whirling wheels on either side — while the maidens, daughters of the sun, hastened to escort it, having left the house of Night for the light and pushed back with their hands the veils from their heads.\nAfter this, Parmenides meets with the goddess, and she unveils the great truths of existence. The goddess says to him:\nYoung man, companion to the immortal charioteers [\u0026hellip;] You must learn all things,both the unwavering heart of persuasive truthand the opinions of mortals in which there is no true trust.Translation from Jonathan Barnes (p. 131)\nThe rest of the poem follows this two-part structure. First it sets out the goddess-revealed truth; and then it plunges into the opinions of mortals.\nThese two ways stand in stark opposition. For Parmenides, you cannot be sort of on the right path. The Way of Opinion is \u0026lsquo;a trail devoid of all knowledge.\u0026rsquo; You are either in the realm of truth, or the realm of opinion; and the split between the two is vast and unbridgeable.\nThe Way of Truth But what is the Way of Truth? At this point, things get more difficult. Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s whole philosophy hinges on the idea of the non-existence of nothingness. In the Sophist, Plato quotes the relevant passage from Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s poem:\nNever will this prevail, that what is not is: restrain your thought from this road of inquiry. Plato, Sophist 237 A\nIf this makes your head spin, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. But let\u0026rsquo;s try to break it down. The idea of \u0026rsquo;nothing\u0026rsquo; is a tricky one. Often, we treat \u0026rsquo;nothing\u0026rsquo; as something that exists alongside other things, as in the following dialogue:\nPhilosopher 1: What\u0026rsquo;s in the box?\nPhilosopher 2: A cat!\n[The cat jumps out\u0026hellip; a few seconds pass.]\nPhilosopher 1: What\u0026rsquo;s in the box now?\nPhilosopher 2: Nothing!\nBut there is a significant difference between these two answers. When we say that a cat is in the box, we are saying that a cat is a thing that exists, and this thing is in the box. But we say that nothing is in the box, we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about \u0026rsquo;nothing\u0026rsquo; as a thing that exists in the box. \u0026lsquo;Nothing\u0026rsquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t refer to any existing thing at all. Nothing simply doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist.\nBut if nothing doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist, Parmenides reasons, then the only thing that can exist is being itself. And what is \u0026lsquo;being\u0026rsquo;? Parmenides argues that once we have got rid of the idea of nothingness, then:\nOnly one story, one road, now is left: that it is. And on this there are signs in plenty that, being, it is ungenerated and indestructible, whole, of one kind and unwavering, and complete. Nor was it, nor will it be, since now it is, all together,one, continuous.\nThis is tricky stuff. But Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s argument is that if nothingness does not exist, then there is only being. And this being cannot be generated (it cannot come out of nothingness) or destroyed (it cannot go back into nothingness). So being fills up everywhere. It is single, unchanging, complete, and continuous.\nBut this has unsettling implications. If being is unchangeable, and if non-being cannot give rise to being, then nothing can ever come into existence or go out of existence. Again, Parmenides writes as follows:\nHow might what is then perish? How might it come into being? For if it came into being it is not, nor is it if it is ever going to be.\nThe startling consequence of this is that nothing ever changes. As Catherine Osborne writes, \u0026rsquo;nothing varies in any way across space or time. What is just is, and it can’t be anything else\u0026rsquo; (p. 44).\nThe Way of Opinion This leaves us with the question of why it is that things seem nevertheless to change. And this takes us from the Way of Truth to his Way of Opinion.\nPerhaps only ten percent of the Way of Opinion section of the poem is still extant, and much of it is pretty scrappy and baffling. But what Parmenides seems to be doing in the final part of his poem is exploring how it is that stuff seems to change, even if logic dictates that things are single, eternal and unchanging.\nSo what\u0026hellip;? At this point, you might be asking: So what? But there are some important implications to Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s ideas. One thing is that Parmenides drives a wedge between how things really are, and how they appear to be. This split was already identified by Thales, who said however things appear, they are in reality all made of water. But with Parmenides, this split between appearance and reality becomes a huge gulf. It suggests that everything we think we know about the world is wrong.\nThe other important implication of Parmenides\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is that it opens up a long line of philosophical argument about what it means to exist at all. What does it mean to say that something is? This is a question that still preoccupies (some) philosophers down to the present day.\nWaiting for the goddess? Parmenides is an enigmatic, difficult and puzzling philosopher. He is as provocative as he is divisive. In dividing the Way of Truth and the Way of Opinion so starkly, he seems to be pessimistic about our ability to say what is true.\nAnd perhaps — unless a kindly goddess happens to pass by, pick us up in her chariot, and explain things to us face to face — our odds of saying whether we are on the Way of Truth or else on the Way of Opinion remain frustratingly slim.\nFurther Reading Books I used Jonathan Barnes\u0026rsquo;s Early Greek Philosophy (Penguin Book 1987) as the source of the quotes from Parmenides.\nCatherine Osborne\u0026rsquo;s Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2004) is particularly excellent on Parmenides. The quote above comes from this book.\nOnline Resources Buddhist-inclined readers may find that this talk of the Way of Opinion and the way of truth is ringing some bells.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Telling tales about the sages There is considerable debate about whether Yājñavalkya is a historical figure or a literary creation (see the Philosopher File on Diotima). If there was a historical figure called Yājñavalkya, his dates would be some time around the 7th century BCE. However, as the scholar Steven Lindquist writes, \u0026lsquo;The textual evidence as we have it does not appear to lend itself, as far as I can determine, to drawing an objective line regarding the historicity of Yājñavalkya.\u0026rsquo;\nNevertheless, the history of philosophy is partly the history of the stories we tell about philosophers. And the Yājñavalkya who emerges from the stories in the Upaniṣads is an extraordinary character.\nThe swaggering philosopher The Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad tells us Yājñavalkya was a ritual specialist from the Brahmin priestly class. He was advisor to King Janaka, and had two wives: the philosopher Maitreyī, with whom he debated the nature of the soul, and Kātyāyanī, whose understanding, the text dismissively says, \u0026lsquo;was limited only to womanly matters.\u0026rsquo;\nIn the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, Yājñavalkya takes part in a debate held by King Janaka (where we have already met him debating fiercely with Gārgī Vācaknavī). The King offers a prize for the philosopher who triumphs. Yājñavalkya, convinced he will prevail, brazenly makes off with the prize before the debate even begins: one thousand cows, the horns of each one hung with ten pieces of gold.\nWhat is striking when reading the account of the debate is the audacity of Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s philosophical swagger, his overbearingness, and his skill in wrong-footing his opponents. So whether Yājñavalkya existed or not, the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad is a testament to a growing interest in philosophical debate within the intellectual traditions of India, and to the ways in which these debates were tangled up with questions of status and prestige.\nPhilosophy The debates in the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad mark a transition point in the religious traditions of India from the earlier focus on ritual as a way of sustaining the order of the world, to a more philosophically motivated attempt to grapple with reality.\nDebate with Maitreyī: the immortal self When later on in life, Yājñavalkya tires of his wealth — all those cows and gold coins! — he decides to go off and become a wandering philosopher-sage.\nAccording to the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, he speaks with his two wives, and tells them he wants to bequeath them his wealth. But Maitreyī isn\u0026rsquo;t interested in cows. Instead, she says to him, \u0026lsquo;If I were to possess the entire world filled with wealth, sir, would it, or would it not, make me immortal?\u0026rsquo; Yājñavalkya admits that wealth is only wealth, and does not have much to do with immortality. Then Maitreyī presses her husband for something more valuable than herds of cows: the wisdom that might lead to immortality.\nAnd so Yājñavalkya talks about love. He asks why we love spouses, children, wealth, possessions or power. Not because we love these things in themselves, but because we love our self, our ātman.\nBut Maitreyī presses him further: what, she asks, is this ātman? It is a good question. The term ātman has multiple meanings: it is a reflexive pronoun meaning \u0026lsquo;oneself\u0026rsquo;; it can refer to our own physicality; it is the fundamental ground of our cognition (\u0026rsquo;the unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought-of-thinker, the unknown knower\u0026rsquo;, the text says); and it is the metaphysical ground of our being that links us, if we can only see it, to the entire cosmos.\nThis very self (ātman) is the lord and king of all beings. As all the spokes are fastened to the hub and the rim of a wheel, so to one\u0026rsquo;s self are fastened all beings, all the gods, all the worlds, all the breaths, and all these bodies. Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, 2.5.15\nThe caterpillar self For Yājñavalkya, this self or ātman endures beyond death, only to be reborn (see the Pythagorean philosophers). In a beautiful image, the text says that after death, the ātman reaches out to take a new body, the way a caterpillar at the tip of a blade of grass \u0026lsquo;reaches out to a new foothold and draws itself onto it.\u0026rsquo;\nThe Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad gives a more precise mechanism for how this happens. At one point in the text, the sage Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga asks Yājñavalkya if anything survives the dispersal of death. In reply, Yājñavalkya takes Ārtabhāga to one side and confides in him.\nYājñavalkya replied: \u0026ldquo;My friend, we cannot talk about this in public. Take my hand, Ārtabhāga; let\u0026rsquo;s go and discuss this in private.\u0026rdquo; So they left and talked about it. And what did they talk about?—they talked about nothing but action. And what did they praise?—they praised nothing but action. Yājñavalkya told him: \u0026ldquo;A man turns into something good by good action and into something bad by bad action.\u0026ldquo;Thereupon, Jāratkārava Ārtabhāga fell silent.Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, 3.3.2\nWhat is new here is the conjunction of three ideas that are woven together to subsequently become a central thread in many of the philosophical traditions of India.\nThe first is the idea of the ātman that is repeatedly reborn; the second is the idea that it is \u0026lsquo;action\u0026rsquo; or karma that determines the nature of this rebirth; and the third is the idea that the mechanism governing rebirth is a moral one: we turn into something good by good action, and something bad by bad action.\nEscaping the cycle This is not quite the end of the story, for there is a way out of this endless cycle. Once we recognise that ātman is the same as brahman, the ultimate ground of everything, we are freed from desire. And in this freedom from desire, we are liberated from the round of rebirths, so that we can dwell in the unity of self and everything else:\nClearly, this self is brahman—this self that is made of perception, made of mind, made of sight, made of breath, made of hearing, made of earth, made of water, made of wind, made of space, made of light and the lightless, made of desire and the desireless, made of anger and the angerless, made of the righteous and the unrighteous; this self that is made of everything\u0026hellip;Now, a man who does not desire—who is without desires, who is freed from desires, whose desires are fulfilled, whose only desire is his self—his vital functions do not depart. Brahman he is, and to brahman he goes. Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad 4.4.6\nThis is Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s trump-card. And King Janaka is delighted by his teaching on the unity of ātman and brahman. \u0026lsquo;Here, sir,\u0026rsquo; he says to Yājñavalkya, \u0026lsquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll give you a thousand cows!\u0026rsquo;\nFurther Reading Books For Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s historicity, try Steven Lindquist\u0026rsquo;s chapter in Religion and Identity in South Asia and Beyond ed.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life The first scientist? The philosopher Anaximander was born in the trading port of Miletus in 610 BCE, and is said to have become a student of the philosopher Thales. He was fascinated by processes of generation and destruction in the natural world. It is for this reason that the physicist Carlo Rovelli has called Anaximander \u0026rsquo;the first scientist':\nHe paved the way for physics, geography, meteorology, and biology. Even more important than these contributions, he set in motion the process of rethinking our worldview—a search for knowledge based on the rejection of any obvious-seeming “certainty,” which is one of the main roots of scientific thinking.— \u0026lsquo;The First Scientist\u0026rsquo; by Carlo Rovelli\nAnaximander is also the first Greek philosopher whom we know to have written his philosophy down, in a book that is usually referred to with the title On Nature. The book has not survived, other than a few brief fragments.\nAnother reason that Anaximander deserves the name \u0026rsquo;the first scientist\u0026rsquo; is his omnivorous curiosity. Later accounts show that his writing covered a huge range of topics: from astronomy to meteorology to biology. On Nature was an early attempt to pay close attention to the things of the world, and the processes by means of which they transformed into each other.\nMaps and travels Anaximander is also credited with being a restless traveller. He visited Sparta and, according to some accounts, set up a colony of citizens from Miletus on the Black Sea coast at Apollonia, now Sozopol in Bulgaria. He is also said to have been the first person in Greece to produce a map of the known world. One ancient account reads:\nAnaximander of Miletus, a pupil of Thales, was the first man bold enough to draw the inhabited world on a tablet; after him, Hecataeus of Miletus, a great traveller, made it more accurate so that it was greatly admired.— The \u0026lsquo;Geography\u0026rsquo; of Agathemerus\nIf it ever existed, the map — like so much of his work — has not survived. But the geographer Hecataeus, who lived in Miletus a generation later, is said to have taken his map and improved it, producing the map that became the standard map for the ancient Greek world.\nPhilosophy Anaximander followed Thales in his conviction that underneath the bewildering variety of things there lay a much simpler, more basic principle, an ultimate reality. The Greek term for this ultimate reality is arche, meaning \u0026lsquo;origin\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;beginning.\u0026rsquo; It is the root of present-day words like \u0026lsquo;archaeology\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;archive.\u0026rsquo; For Thales, this principle was water. But for Anaximander, it was something altogether more mysterious: something he called the apeiron, or the \u0026lsquo;boundless.\u0026rsquo;\nBoundless interpretations Thales\u0026rsquo;s claim that the principle of all things was water had the advantage of being at least comprehensible, even if he turned out to be wrong. But for most of history, later philosophers have complained that the trouble with Anaximander is that it is not at all clear what this seemingly abstract idea of the \u0026lsquo;boundless\u0026rsquo; actually is. And this has left room for all kinds of interpretations about what it was that Anaximander was on about.\nOne later account says that this apeiron is the principle that underlies the generation, existence and destruction of all things. It is the unchanging principle, beyond all our experience, that underlies all change, and that \u0026lsquo;contains all the worlds.\u0026rsquo; It is in accordance with this principle that all life emerges. And it is in accordance with this principle that human beings appear in the world (who, Anaximander says with considerable prescience, \u0026lsquo;originally resembled another type of animal, namely fish.\u0026rsquo;)\nCreative power One persuasive interpretation of what Anaximander is up to comes from the contemporary Czech philosopher Radim Kočandrle, who argues that apeiron is not a thing, but instead a quality that Anaximander ascribes to nature. So instead of being a mysterious (or even mystical) entity that lies behind nature, Anaximander talks of boundlessness as a way of trying to say something about nature itself, and the qualities of things that exist.\nTo get hold of this idea, we need to know what the Greeks meant by \u0026rsquo;nature.\u0026rsquo; The Greek word that is usually translated as \u0026rsquo;nature\u0026rsquo; is physis, from which we get words like \u0026lsquo;physics\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;physical\u0026rsquo;. In Ancient Greece, physis was a word that was first used to talk about the growth of plants. The very early Greek philosophers expanded the meaning, to refer instead to nature of all things, seen as an ongoing process of growth and change.\nIf this interpretation is right, then what Anaximander is saying is something like this. In talking about the apeiron, he is arguing that the universe is boundlessly creative. Individual things may be created and destroyed, but the creative process is not something that is itself created or destroyed. He calls this principle \u0026rsquo;the boundless\u0026rsquo; because it is not localised anywhere in space. Creative ferment is going on everywhere you look (and in all the places you don\u0026rsquo;t look as well). And although we cannot see this creative power in itself, we can see the things that it gives rise to. For Anaximander, in other words, the universe we live in is not static, but inherently, richly creative.\nFurther Reading Books Carlo Rovelli\u0026rsquo;s The First Scientist: Anaximander and his Legacy (Westholme Publishing, 2007) is well worth reading.\nApeiron: Anaximander on Generation and Destruction by Radim Kočandrle and Dirk L. Couprie (Springer 2017) is a short, and very thorough, exploration of the idea of Anaximander\u0026rsquo;s apeiron as creative power.\n",

            "content": "It\u0026rsquo;s a curious image. The philosopher Plato, dressed in a turban and a sash, sits before a pipe organ and plays sweet tunes. Meanwhile, around him lies a catatonic tribe of lions, tigers, antelopes, leopards, deer, rhinos, cranes, phoenixes and other beasts. What\u0026rsquo;s going on here? Are these animals sleeping? Are they dead? What is Plato up to?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a strange and fascinating scene, so yesterday — not having much else to do under lockdown — I set about finding out more.\nIt is not a scene you will find in any of the Greek texts. The image, now in the British Museum, is attributed to the Mughal painter Madhu Khanazad at the end of the sixteenth century. It is an illustration of a part of the Persian book of Sufi poetry, the Khamsa of Nizami, which in turn dates to around 1200. Here\u0026rsquo;s the full picture.\nNizami\u0026rsquo;s Khamsa is particularly famous for the love story of Layla and Majnun. This scene of Platonic music-making occurs later on in the book, in the section dedicated to the exploits of Alexander the Great. In Nizami\u0026rsquo;s story, Alexander calls together a bunch of philosophers. Then he challenges them to a contest to prove who is the wisest. At first, it looks as if Aristotle is going to win, but then Plato gives a strange musical demonstration, and he eventually takes the prize.\nThe story is a fascinating one because of the picture it paints of medieval Islamic views of Plato and Aristotle. Plato is reinvented as a mystic, by way of Neoplatonism and Sufi illuminationism or hikmat-i ishrāq, which was in the ascendant in Persia at the time the book was written.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t track down an English version of the story, but I did find a version in German by J.C. Bürgel. So my English retelling is based on Bürgel\u0026rsquo;s (see the references at the end). It sticks pretty close to the original text.\nPlato Makes Music to Shame Aristotle Adapted from the Khamsa of Nizami The ruler Alexander, whose tongue and mind were like flame and candle-wax, summoned the philosophers of his empire to a debate, to see who was the greatest. In the palace, the philosophers sat at the foot of Alexander\u0026rsquo;s throne in a line. And there they talked about logic and magic, mathematics and art, theology and science. But after every philosopher spoke, the great Aristotle always found something else to add: some extra subtlety, some further thought\nThe philosophers were awed by Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s wisdom and insight. “I am the leader of all in matters of wisdom,” Aristotle bragged. “This judgement is not a lie. It is not arrogance. It is simply how things are.” And Alexander was inclined to agree.\nBut Plato, who had not yet spoken, was indignant. He made himself scarce and fled the palace, the way a phoenix can suddenly disappear. He took himself to a solitary place and hid himself away in a barrel. There in his lonely retreat, Plato followed the traces of the spheres and tracks of the stars. He listened for their harmonies, traced their pattern.\nWhen he had complete knowledge of the sounds, Plato made a musical instrument, fashioning wood, making strings, stretching gazelle-leather over a gourd, and rubbing the skin with musk so the sounds were sweet. When he was done, he had made a contraption that could sing out high and low, in loud and soft tones. His instrument could emulate the sounds of all living beings — even the lion and the ox — a music that could speak to the individual nature of every living thing, could testify to their suffering and joys.\nPlato went out into the desert, taking his strange contraption with him. He drew a circle around himself and sat down. Then he began to play. The moment he did so, the wild animals from the mountains and the plains all came running. They put their heads down on the line that Plato had drawn, lost their senses, and collapsed to the ground as if dead. Wolves and lambs, lions and wild asses: they all snoozed peaceably next to each other.\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s music of the spheres could do this: whether you were an ass or a lion or a human being, it could bring you to a sleep so deep it was almost like death, and then it could revive you and you could go on your way refreshed.\nThe news of this wonderful music spread quickly, as far as Alexander\u0026rsquo;s palace. When Aristotle heard about Plato\u0026rsquo;s skill, he was plunged into depression. How could he be so outdone by his predecessor? So he brooded in the dark of Alexander\u0026rsquo;s castle, and after long reflection, his keen mind penetrated all the way to the bottom of Plato\u0026rsquo;s sublime art. He made a musical instrument of his own, and he hurried out to the desert to give it a try.\nAristotle\u0026rsquo;s instrument more or less worked. He could lull anybody to sleep, just as Plato could. But stirring them back to life turned out to be a bigger problem, and no matter how much Aristotle struggled to find the right mode or harmony, he failed.\nSo in the end, Aristotle swallowed his pride and went to see his teacher Plato: “I know the mode that lulls people into unconsciousness,” he said, “but I do not know the one that brings the spirit back from its sleeping.”\nPlato offered to teach Aristotle his art. Again Plato drew a circle about them both, and he started to play. Again the animals came running, put their heads on the line, and fell asleep. Aristotle more or less knew how to do as much, and was not greatly impressed. But then Plato modulated into a new key. The music was sweet as nectar, and Aristotle immediately lost consciousness. Whilst Aristotle was passed out, Plato changed key again, and he woke up the animals. Once the animals were restored to consciousness, Plato woke Aristotle.\nAristotle got to his feet like a ray of fire, confused by what had happened, annoyed he had missed Plato\u0026rsquo;s profound teaching. But then seeing he was outwitted, he apologised for his arrogance, and praised Plato for his greater powers.\nOnly then did Plato teach the much chastened Aristotle what it meant to play the modes that reflected the harmonies of the heavenly spheres. And from then onwards, Aristotle never ceased praising Plato for his greater wisdom. As for Alexander, when news of Plato\u0026rsquo;s demonstration reached him, he showered honours upon the older philosopher, acknowledging him as the wisest man in all Greece.\nReferences: My retelling is taken from the German translation in \u0026ldquo;Der Wettstreit zwischen Plato und Aristoteles im Alexander-Epos des persischen Dichters Nizami\u0026rdquo; by J.C.

            "title": "Gārgī Vācaknavī, the Eloquent Philosopher",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Gārgī Vācaknavī appears in the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, a philosophical compilation that dates to around the seventh or the sixth century BCE, although it contains strains of material that may be much older. She is one of the earliest named women philosophers in the Indian tradition, and may have lived some time around 700 BCE. Her name Gārgī suggests she traced her lineage back to the sage Garga, and Vācaknavī means “eloquent”, coming from the word “vāc”, or speech.\nLife and legend We don\u0026rsquo;t have any reliable biography for Gārgī Vācaknavī. But we do have a fascinating account in the Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad of the part she played in a palace debate about the nature of reality.\nThe debate was organised by King Janaka of Videha, who wanted to find out who among the scholars in his kingdom was most skilled in interpreting the Vedas, or the religious texts. To encourage the scholars to participate, King Janaka rounded up one thousand cows, tied ten pieces of gold to the horns of each cow, and offered the entire herd to the winner. But before the competition started, the cocky philosopher-sage Yājñavalkya — convinced that there was no contest — made off with the prize. Only a handful of other sages, among them Gārgī Vācaknavī, were willing to stand up to Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s swagger.\nPhilosophy What is fascinating about Gārgī Vācaknavī is not so much the conclusions that she draws, but the fierce style with which she goes about debating with the self-assured Yājñavalkya. She pursues her questioning, and her opponent, with a single-mindedness that still has the power to take your breath away.\nWeaving the world Gārgī begins the debate with a question: “Since the whole world is woven back and forth on water, on what, then, is water woven back and forth?” Over in Greece, Thales might find himself agreeing with Gārgī\u0026rsquo;s starting point, that the world is \u0026lsquo;woven\u0026rsquo; on water. But Thales didn\u0026rsquo;t think to ask what Gārgī does: what, then, is water itself woven on?\nYājñavalkya doesn\u0026rsquo;t object to Gārgī\u0026rsquo;s premise that the world is woven on water; and her question at first doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to trouble him. He remains cool and unruffled, and calmly replies that water is woven back and forth upon something else: air.\nBut Gārgī is not satisfied with this answer. She continues to push her questions further:\n\u0026ldquo;On what, then, is air woven back and forth?\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;On the worlds of the intermediate region, Gārgī.\u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;On what, then, are the worlds of the intermediate region woven back and forth\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; — Bṛhadāraṅyaka Upaniṣad, translated by Patrick Olivelle\nAnd so it goes on. Until eventually, Yājñavalkya says that everything is woven back and forth on \u0026rsquo;the worlds of brahman\u0026rsquo; — the supreme reality.\nThe limits of argument You might think that Gārgī would be satisfied with this; but she isn\u0026rsquo;t, and she wants to go still further. What, she presses, are the worlds of brahman woven back and forth upon? But at this point, Yājñavalkya simply refuses to answer. He tells Gārgī, “Don\u0026rsquo;t ask too many questions\u0026hellip; your head will shatter apart!”\nWhy does Yājñavalkya refuse to play the game any further? Are there some mysteries about which you simply shouldn\u0026rsquo;t ask? Is Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s response an attempt at a counter-argument, as if to say — like Wittgenstein a few millennia later — \u0026lsquo;Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent\u0026rsquo;? Or does gender play a role here? Has Yājñavalkya got fed up with being questioned by a woman, and resorted the threat of violence?\nIt is not clear. But whatever the reason, Gārgī doesn\u0026rsquo;t press the point. Instead, she falls silent — at least for the time being — and lets another speaker take the floor.\nFrom debater to judge But that is not the end of the story. Because shortly after in the debate, Gārgī speaks up again. This time, she doesn\u0026rsquo;t go head to head with Yājñavalkya directly. Instead, she turns to address the rest of the scholars. Okay, she tells them, I\u0026rsquo;m going to ask Yājñavalkya two questions.\nThe contemporary scholar Ravi Gupta points out that this subtle pivoting is momentous in its implications. It switches her role from being subordinate in a bullying debate to being a judge. Henceforth, Gārgī says, she will ask Yājñavalkya the questions; and she will adjudicate on whether his answers are in line with the truth or not.\nSo Gārgī Vācaknavī restates the question: what is this whole world woven on? And this time, Yājñavalkya responds by saying it is woven on space. Gārgī\u0026rsquo;s response is almost sarcastic: “All honour to you,” she says, “You really cleared that up for me!”\nThen she moves on to her second question. The question is almost inevitable. What, she asks, is space woven on? And Yājñavalkya, on the spot, does his best to give a more sustained answer. He says that space is woven on the “imperishable”: the mysterious underlying reality of all things that is “neither coarse nor fine, neither short nor long.” And he gives a short discourse on this “imperishable”, this thing that, he claims, is the source of all things, and of all order in the world.\nWhen Yājñavalkya has finished speaking, Gārgī now turns to the audience. They are waiting for her to pass judgement on Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s answer: is he speaking the truth, or is he spouting nonsense? You can almost feel the tension of the moment before Gārgī speaks. But then she hands down her judgement: Yājñavalkya is right, she says. Not only this, but the other sages should consider themselves lucky if they never have to debate with him, for they will never defeat him.\nHer judgement is finely honed, and perhaps once again laced with sarcasm. Gārgī has affirmed Yājñavalkya\u0026rsquo;s words. But the cost to her former opponent is great. He has surrendered his authority to the eloquent Gārgī. She has set herself up as the arbiter of what it true, and what is not. And even though the cocksure Yājñavalkya gets his gold-bedecked cows to take away, it is, presumably, with a deflated sense of his own powers in debate, and of his own importance.\nFurther Reading Books There are many translations of the Upaniṣads available. I like Patrick Olivelle\u0026rsquo;s The Early Upaniṣads: Annotated Text and Translation (Oxford University Press 1998), which has a nice balance of scholarship and readability.\nSigne Cohen\u0026rsquo;s The Upaniṣads: A Complete Guide (Routledge 2018) is a great introduction to these fascinating texts.\nOnline Resources This is an interesting piece from Aeon Magazine on the role of women in early philosophy outside of Europe.\nThe story of Gārgī\u0026rsquo;s debate is a bit more complex than suggested here. For a fun dive into the debate\u0026rsquo;s finer nuances, listen to the What\u0026rsquo;s Her Name Podcast on Gārgī with Ravi M. Gupta, and learn how Gārgī shows us how to handle social media debates.\n",

            "title": "On the Virtues of Cats",
            "tags": ["Blogs",],
            "content": "Two days ago, Aslan the foster cat moved in. He\u0026rsquo;s a big ginger and white beast, and he was found on the streets of Sofia, Bulgaria. He\u0026rsquo;s settled in well, and is now lording it over all of us here in Slaveykov Square. So I thought that was a good opportunity to read John Gray\u0026rsquo;s brisk and breezy new book Feline Philosophy: Cats and the Meaning of Life.\nIt might seem odd that Gray — famous for his philosophical pessimism — has decided to lapse into whimsy and write about cats. But Gray uses cat-being as a foil for talking about everything that is wrong with human-being. “Cats are arch-realists,” Gray writes. “Faced with human folly, they simply walk away\u0026hellip;” And even if I found myself disagreeing with some of his conclusions, I was struck by the sharpness of his insights. This makes Feline Philosophy an entertaining read.\nThe philosophical cats of China Gray draws on the traditions of Daoism to remind us humans of our creaturely nature — something of which cats do not need to be reminded. He argues that in Daoism, “Each individual animal, every single creature, has its own form of the good life” (p 28).\nHaving lived for years both with cats and with Daoist arguments, I can see that there is a good argument that cats could be seen as natural Daoists. Traditional Daoist ideas like “free and easy wandering\u0026quot; (xiaoyao you 逍遙遊) and “the usefulness of being useless” (wuyong zhi wei yong 無用之為用) sound like they could have been concocted by cats, or specifically to capture the essence of what it is like to be a cat.\nCuriously, however, we don\u0026rsquo;t know if the ancient Daoists hung around with cats. There\u0026rsquo;s no clear textual evidence, and the first unambiguous Chinese reference to domestic cats only appears in a Buddhist text in the 2nd century CE. The Confucians, on the other hand, have a lot to say about cats.\nThis brings me to the brilliant essay, “Walking by Itself: The Singular History of the Chinese Cat”, by Timothy H. Barrett and Mark Strange, which traces the history of philosophical cats in China. Along the way, the authors take us from Buddhist charms against cat demons, through cat-based divination, to a Confucian debate about feline virtues, and whether cats can be said to be innately good.\nThe virtues of cats (and humans) As I sit here contemplating Aslan\u0026rsquo;s many virtues, I find myself sentimentally drawn to saying, \u0026lsquo;yes, of course cats are capable of goodness! He\u0026rsquo;s only been here for two days, but Aslan seems both singular in his habits, and also unusually courteous. If pressed, I might even be tempted to say that he is a cat of uncommon virtue.\nBut even if he can be said to be virtuous, the question that really preoccupied the Confucians was this: is feline virtue innate? Or are cats good only because they hang around in the best of company? In other words, is Aslan virtuous (to the extent that he is) in and of himself? Or is he virtuous because he has lived with virtuous human beings some time in his troubled and mysterious past, and their virtue has rubbed off on him?\nThis feline philosophy debate draws on a long divide in Chinese Confucian philosophy between the followers of the philosopher Mencius (372 — 289 BCE), who argued that goodness was natural and innate, and the followers of Xunzi (310 — c. 235 BCE) who argued that goodness was artificial. When applied to cats, these two scholarly positions are represented by Han Yu (768–824 CE) and Sima Guang (1019–86).\nHan Yu takes the same position as Xunzi. He makes the claim that cats, in their natural state, have no moral sense. But, he says, if they hang out with morally upright people, they can become artificially good. Cats, he says, “do not tend by nature towards kindness or propriety.” But they can become good if they happen to live in good Confucian homes.\nA few centuries later, in the Song dynasty, the scholar Sima Guang argues that Han Yu is wrong. To prove it, Sima Guang sits down to write a biography of Shu, his thick-eared house cat, recording the animal\u0026rsquo;s many virtues. The biography begins with the bold claim that, “Humaneness, righteousness and celestial virtue are not only bestowed among humans; all beings have the nature of this consciousness.”\nBy the end of his argument, Sima Guang has concluded that cats can be innately virtuous or unvirtuous. But this has a further implication: it suggests that there is no moral hierarchy between human beings and other living things. If you follow Han Yu, feline virtue is only ever borrowed from the cat\u0026rsquo;s good (and presumably Confucian) owner. If you follow Sima Guang, cats can be virtuous in their own right. As the later philosopher argues, there are many people who know nothing of virtue, who are corrupt, or who are selfish: but when it comes to such matters, Shu the cat\u0026rsquo;s conscience is clear.\nFeline flourishing For me, however, I\u0026rsquo;m not entirely convinced. After reading Gray\u0026rsquo;s book, it seems to me that Sima Guang\u0026rsquo;s notion of morality is a little too human-centred to really account for cat-being.\nLike a latter-day Socrates, Gray complains that “When people talk of morality they do not know what it is they are talking about” (p. 26). But instead of ditching the idea of virtue altogether, he argues for another notion of virtue that is potentially more promising, a notion that can cut across species. He resists the temptation to read human ethics into the animal world. Instead, he takes a broader view of ethics that can encompass ourselves, but also many other members of the animal kingdom.\nInstead, the good life means living for yourself with the nature you have been given. To be sure, the good life requires virtues – traits and skills that make it possible to survive and flourish – but these virtues concern not only what we have been taught to think of as morality. They also include aesthetics, hygiene and the whole art of life, and they are not confined to human beings.In this understanding, ethics – from ethikos in the Greek language, meaning ‘character’ or ‘arising from habit’ – is found among non-human animals.Feline Philosophy, p. 27\nThis may not be the kind of virtue that Han Yu attributes to cats. It may not be the kind of virtue that I might want, in my more sentimentally Confucian moments, to attribute to the estimable Aslan. But it is a kind of virtue nevertheless. And it is one of which both Daoists (and those cats who are natural Daoists) might approve.\nReferences: Gray, John.

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Guan Zhong (720 – 645 BCE) is one of the earliest named Chinese philosophers. He became Chancellor in the state of Qi, and was the traditionally cited as the author of a book called the Guanzi (or \u0026lsquo;Master Guan\u0026rsquo;), a vast treatise on statecraft, economics, politics and philosophy.\nHowever, the evidence is that early versions of the Guanzi probably date back only to the second century BCE, and the text as it has come down to us was complied in the first century BCE by a scholar called Liu Xiang. This means that almost no material in the Guanzi can be reliably said to be authored by Guan Zhong. Nevertheless, the fact that such a vast, sprawling treatise on politics, economics and philosophy should be attributed to Guan Zhong shows his symbolic importance as a political thinker for later generations.\nGuan and Bao One of the main sources for Guan Zhong\u0026rsquo;s life is the Shiji or the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian, completed around five hundred years after Guan\u0026rsquo;s death.\nSima Qian is always more entertaining than he is reliable. One of the stories he tells is of Guan Zhong\u0026rsquo;s long-standing friendship with Bao Shuya. Guan was brought up in poverty, but the much more well-off Bao recognised his sharp mind and his talent, and befriended him.\nIn 685 BCE, at the end of a bloody three-year civil war in Qi, Guan found himself on the losing side. He attempted unsuccessfully to assassinate Prince Xiaobai. And when the Prince seized control of the reins of power and was anointed Duke Huan of Qi, Guan was taken prisoner. After his arrest, Guan was threatened with execution. Bao, who was on the winning side, intervened on Guan\u0026rsquo;s behalf, and persuaded the Duke to appoint his friend to the role of Chancellor. The Duke relented, and Guan Zhong\u0026rsquo;s life was spared.\nPolitical and economic reforms Once appointed, Guan put in place a wide range of technocratic reforms that considerably increased the power of the state of Qi. His reforms included the introduction of compulsory military service, the issuing of coinage, the standardization of measurements throughout the state of Qi, and extensive tax reforms. He also centralized the management of iron and salt reserves, bringing these under the control of the state.\nPhilosophy Guan\u0026rsquo;s greatest political legacy was a considerably strengthened state of Qi. But his philosophical legacy is harder to establish. Despite — or perhaps because of — his political success, he remained a controversial figure for later philosophers.\nConfucius on Guan Zhong Confucius was born a century after Guan Zhong\u0026rsquo;s death, and Guan appears several times in Confucius\u0026rsquo;s Analects. But Confucius clearly had a hard time working Guan out.\nAt one point in the Analects, Confucius complains about Guan\u0026rsquo;s lack of ritual propriety, asking acidly, \u0026lsquo;If Guan Zhong can be said to understand ritual, who does not understand it?\u0026rsquo; But later on, when Confucius\u0026rsquo;s disciple Zigong calls Guan out for switching sides in the civil war, Confucius steps in to defend him, saying that despite his initial impropriety,\nWithout Guan Zhong, we would all be wearing our hair loose, and our robes folded on the left! So would it be better if he had gone and drowned himself in a ditch..? — Analects, Confucius.\nIt is a strange passage; but what Confucius is saying is that thanks to Guan Zhong\u0026rsquo;s reforms, later generations have enjoyed a more orderly and harmonious society. What, then, would be better? That Guan Zhong had never lived (and everybody wore their hair loose)? Or that he had lived with some impropriety, but put in place a legacy of a better world (and better hair) for those who came after him?\nThe roots of legalism? Guan Zhong is often associated with the Chinese philosophy known as \u0026rsquo;legalism\u0026rsquo;. The term is a controversial one. It was invented by Sima Tan, the father of the historian Sima Qian, and is associated in particular with the rise of the Qin dynasty from 247 BCE.\nIn Chinese, the word for legalism is fajia (法家). Fa can mean \u0026rsquo;law\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;method\u0026rsquo;, and jia means \u0026lsquo;school\u0026rsquo;, as in philosophical school. This means that fajia could be translated as \u0026rsquo;the school of law,\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;the school of method.\u0026rsquo; But fa can equally mean something like \u0026lsquo;following a particular course,\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;following a specific model.\u0026rsquo; So fajia could also be said to be the philosophy school that is committed to finding more efficient models for governing.\nThe term \u0026rsquo;legalism\u0026rsquo; is normally used as a catch-all term for a range of philosophical approaches concerned with questions of statecraft, bureaucracy and the design of models for effective government. Many legalist approaches are based on the idea that harsh laws are required for society to function. It is for this reason that \u0026rsquo;legalism\u0026rsquo; or fajia is sometimes used as a term of abuse, as a way of criticizing political approaches that seem excessively rigid and harsh, and that rely on systems of rewards and punishments for maintaining order.\nWhether or not the term \u0026rsquo;legalism\u0026rsquo; is useful for understanding early Chinese philosophy, many scholars still see Guan Zhong as an innovator in political thought. He was the first to act on the idea that good government involves the systematic technocratic control of resources, territory, taxation and populations, introducing a novel approach to political philosophy into the Chinese tradition.\n‌ Further Reading Books The Guanzi is translated into English by W. Allyn Rickett (Princeton University Press 2001), although it pays to remember that its connection with Guan Zhong may be tenuous.\nYou can find the material on Guan Zhong in chapters 3 and 14 of Confucius\u0026rsquo;s Analects. I particularly like the translation by Edward Slingerland (Hackett 2003)\nOnline Resources If you want to read in more detail about the political and economic ideas in the Guanzi, try this article on \u0026lsquo;the heavy and the light\u0026rsquo; from historian Kevin Wilson.\nFor later Chinese legalism around the Qin dynasty, try this episode of In Our Time on the BBC.\n",

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Pythagoras was born some time after 570 BCE on the island of Samos. Some accounts say he travelled widely during his early life, as far as Egypt, Babylonia and Persia, and this may have had an influence on his philosophical development. Other stories say that he visited both Thales and Anaximander in Miletus whilst in his twenties. All these stories may be true, but we know little about his early life for certain.\nWhat we do know is that around 530 BCE, he travelled to Kroton, a Greek city that is in present-day Italy; and there he settled and founded his own philosophical school. Pythagoras quickly gained a large following in Kroton, and became a significant influence on the life of the city.\nSecrecy and silence The Pythagorean school functioned like a religious community, bound by strict rules and by secrecy. Entry into the Pythagorean community was arduous, and may have involved undertaking a five-year vow of silence, where new initiates listened to the teachings, but were not permitted to speak.\nOne result of this secrecy is that it is hard to say precisely what it was the early Pythagoreans taught. They were probably largely vegetarian, and lived in a state of communal austerity. Other less than reliable accounts say that Pythagoras also shunned eating beans because — beans being soft and somewhat fleshy — Pythagoras argued they had souls.\nOne thing that made the early Pythagoreans particularly radical was the inclusion of women in the philosophical community. The early records of the Pythagoreans contain multiple accounts of women philosophers, with seventeen women philosophers mentioned by name, including Theano of Kroton, who may have been Pythagoras\u0026rsquo;s wife, and who was a prolific writer, even though little of her writing remains.\nPythagoreans in power For all its secrecy, the Pythagorean community grew quickly, and it became important to the political life of Kroton. Many members of the Pythagorean community rose to positions of political power across southern Italy. And the Pythagoreans have been credited with playing a role in Kroton\u0026rsquo;s military victory over the neighbouring city-state of Sybaris, their discipline and focus helping the state of Kroton overcome the famously lax Sybarites.\nBut political power always comes with a cost. And as the Pythagoreans gained in power, they attracted enemies. Later accounts talk about uprisings against Pythagorean communities. It is said that Pythagoras himself fled Kroton, and went into exile in the city of Metapontum, in the very south of present-day Italy.\nAccording to some accounts, this is where he died. His enemies tracked him to Metapontum, and then they pursued him to the edges of a bean-field. Not wanting to trample on the beans, and to destroy so many souls, Pythagoras chose death instead. This story, although colourful, is not entirely plausible. Philosophy Pythagoras was the first philosopher to talk about philosophia (φιλοσοφία) or \u0026rsquo;the love of wisdom.\u0026rsquo; The idea of loving wisdom puts a distance between ourselves and wisdom: if we love wisdom, it is precisely because we are not wise (see also the Philosopher File on Diotima). Two ideas in particular are associated with the Pythagorean pursuit of wisdom: the idea of the transmigration of souls; and the idea that numbers are somehow fundamental to reality.\nTravelling souls One of Pythagoras\u0026rsquo;s distinctive teachings was the transmigration of the soul. In other words, the soul is something that exists beyond death, and that can be reborn in other bodies: whether human or animal. There is a famous story told by Diogenes Laërtius about Pythagoras and a dog. One day, the philosopher came across somebody beating a puppy. Pythagoras intervened and told the man to stop. He said that in the puppy\u0026rsquo;s squeals he recognised the voice of one of his deceased friends.\nLater Greek thinkers traced this idea of the transmigration of the soul back to Egypt; and it may provide some evidence of Pythagoras\u0026rsquo;s youthful travel. It is an idea that appears again in the work of Plato, although he doesn\u0026rsquo;t cite Pythagoras as a source. And although the idea of the soul\u0026rsquo;s transmigration didn\u0026rsquo;t take hold after Pythagoras and Plato, it may have influenced the Western philosophical traditions in more subtle ways. Because if the soul can move from body to body — as both Pythagoras and Plato argued — this means that body and soul are, in principle, separable. And this idea of the separability of the body and the soul has endured for centuries in the traditions of philosophy that trace their origins back to Ancient Greece.\nNumbers Numbers were central to Pythagorean philosophy. Today Pythagoras is still chiefly famous for his theorem: the square of the hypotenuse of a triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. More recent evidence suggests that this was already well-known in both India and Babylonia, and that the idea predates Pythagoras by up to 1000 years. So Pythagoras cannot be credited with its discovery; but he or his followers may have been responsible for introducing it to the Greek world.\nThe Pythagoreans were also associated with the idea that the universe as a whole is underpinned by numbers. Aristotle, no fan Pythagoras, wrote that:\nFor them [the Pythagoreans] the entire universe is constructed from numbers — Aristotle, Metaphysics\nBut the actual view of Pythagoras may have been more subtle. One fragment attributed to Theano says that:\nI have learned that many Greeks think Pythagoras said everything is created from number. This statement itself raises a question. How can what does not exist think and reproduce? But he did not say everything is derived from number, but everything is generated according to number, that the primary order is in number.\nIf this passage is authentic, it suggests that Aristotle got Pythagoras wrong. It is not that, as Aristotle claims, everything is made up of numbers. Theano recognises that in themselves numbers can\u0026rsquo;t reproduce or create anything. Instead, she argues that there is a mathematical regularity underpinning the world.\nThis is an idea that has remained immensely powerful throughout the two and a half thousand years since Pythagoras\u0026rsquo;s time.\nFurther Reading Books If you are interested in the role of women in early Pythagorean communities, then I highly recommend Sarah B. Pomeroy\u0026rsquo;s Pythagorean Women: Their History and Writings (Johns Hopkins University Press 2013). The quote from Theano comes from this book (p. 67).\nOne of the best surveys of Pythagoras and his school is Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: A Brief History by Charles H. Kahn (Hackett 2001).\nOnline Resources Here\u0026rsquo;s some fun background from Atlas Obscura on the role of beans in the ancient world.\n",

            "content": "Life Perhaps fittingly for a philosopher who saw change as fundamental to the universe, our knowledge about Heraclitus himself is similarly changeable and hard to pin down. At various times in history, he has been referred to as the \u0026lsquo;weeping philosopher\u0026rsquo; (due to his supposed pessimism), and \u0026lsquo;Heraclitus the Obscure.\u0026rsquo; And this obscurity is amplified by the fact that all we have left of Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s philosophy are scattered fragments quoted by later writers.\nThis mysterious philosopher was born around the year 535 BCE in Ephesus, close to Miletus (also the home town of Thales and Diotima). He is said to have written a book called On Nature, which he gave to the temple to Artemis in Ephesus for safe-keeping; but the book has not survived.\nUnreliable Biographies Later biographies of Heraclitus say that he was from a high-ranking family in Ephesus, and turned away from the opportunity of becoming king of Ephesus so he could give his attention to philosophy. The biographies say he shunned society, and had a low opinion of his fellow human beings. But none of these accounts are particularly reliable. According to the later writer Diogenes Laërtius, he was so appalled by society that he took to the hills, where he subsisted on mountain plants.\nDiogenes Laërtius also tells some lurid, but unsubstantiated, stories of Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s death, which was traditionally at the age of sixty. According to Diogenes, Heraclitus suffered from oedema, or fluid retention, and attempted to cure himself by smearing himself in cow-dung to draw out the moisture. It was whilst smeared with cow dung that he died: either through overheating after lying all day in the sun, or torn apart by dogs. The story, however, has the whiff of untruth, and like all the stories told by Diogenes Laërtius should be taken lightly.\nPhilosophy It is impossible to reconstruct the whole of Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s philosophy, and his book On Nature has not survived. But from the fragments that remain, it is possible to see Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s distinctive vision of the world. In this vision, the world is in a state of perpetual flux, always changeable.\nA Flowing World Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s most famous saying is \u0026rsquo;everything flows.\u0026rsquo; Many other fragments from Heraclitus support this idea that the world is a series of constant transformations. One recorded fragment says as follows:\nIt is not possible to step into the same river twice.\nIn other words, although we want to pin things down, and want to make sure things stay put for long enough for us to grasp hold of them, the world doesn\u0026rsquo;t work like this. It is complex and shifting.\nThis gets more interesting when you read another of Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s sayings, where he makes the seemingly self-contradictory claim that:\nWe both step and do not step into the same rivers; we both are and are not\u0026hellip;\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s going on here? One answer is that even staying the same involves constant change and flux. The river remains the same river precisely because it is being constantly renewed by new water flowing down from the mountains (just as our bodies remain the same by being constantly renewed by us eating, drinking and living our lives). Permanence itself — the permanence of rivers, of ourselves, and perhaps by extension the permanence of all things — is built upon processes of change and renewal.\nFire and the Exchange of All Things For Heraclitus, change is not just chaotic and disorderly. It takes place according to particular patterns. This leaves Heraclitus with a further question: how does change happen? How can we understand the changing, unpredictable world, whilst also seeing the orderliness of this change? And here we come to another fragment:\nEverything is an exchange for fire, and fire for everything—as goods for gold, and gold for goods\nOne common way of reading this is by saying that for Heraclitus the underlying reality of the world is fire (just as for Thales, the underlying reality of the world was water). But if you read the passage more closely, you can see that this isn\u0026rsquo;t quite what Heraclitus is saying. Instead, he is saying that everything is an exchange for fire. And he explicitly makes an analogy with the way that gold coinage is used for trading between goods.\nIf we take this analogy seriously, it suggests that Heraclitus\u0026rsquo;s philosophy is more subtle than it is sometimes accused of being. The goods that were traded in the marketplace at Ephesus were not made of gold. Gold is not some kind of reality that underlies all these exchanges. Instead, gold acts as a constant measure that can regulate exchange. What money does is that it allows us to draw equivalents: this many chickens are worth this many pigs; one night at an inn is worth so many kilos of beans; seventeen seafaring vessels are worth however many sacks of wheat. The currency itself (gold, in this case) is arbitrary: it could be shells, or almost anything else. It could be something entirely abstract, a set of numbers in a database. What matters for there to be reliable, consistent exchanges like those in the marketplace of Ephesus is for there to be a common measure of exchange.\nSo what Heraclitus is saying (or what he may be saying because he is, after all, \u0026lsquo;Heraclitus the Obscure\u0026rsquo;!) is that the things of the world undergo constant change, transformation and exchange. But there is a constant measure underneath — which he calls fire — just as there is a constant measure underneath the exchanges that happen in the marketplace.\nThe implication is that although the world in changing and in flux, the transformations of the world are underpinned by regularity and order.\nFurther Reading Books The two go-to books on the Presocratic philosophers are The Presocratic Philosophers, by Jonathan Barnes (Routledge 1982), and Catherine Osborne’s Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2004).\nOnline Resources The ancient history encyclopedia has a piece on Heraclitus, contrasting his thought with that of Buddhism.

            "content": "Life Where does philosophy begin?\nIf you ask a Western philosopher, they might say \u0026lsquo;with Socrates.\u0026rsquo; If you ask a Chinese philosopher, they might say, \u0026lsquo;with Confucius.\u0026rsquo; And of course, the question \u0026lsquo;where does philosophy being\u0026rsquo; is a flawed one: the love of wisdom — this business of asking questions about life and existence — has no real beginning. Human beings have always found themselves wondering about the world of which they are a part, wrestling with the strange, baffling business of being alive.\nBut if you wanted to find a candidate for one of the earliest named philosophers, you would need to go back long before Socrates and Confucius. Because one of the earliest philosophers whose name is still familiar to us comes from Africa, and lived around four and a half thousand years ago.\nThe philosopher-politician This early philosopher was called Ptahhotep, and was the first minister to the Pharaoh Djedkare Isesi in the late 25th century BCE. Ptahhotep had multiple roles in government, including responsibility for overseeing the state treasuries, and overseeing the scribes who worked for the Pharaoh.\nToday, Ptahhotep is known mainly for his book, The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the greatest examples of early Egyptian wisdom literature. In his Maxims, Ptahhotep says that he is already old, and he petitions the Pharaoh to be permitted to retire from his post, so that he can be replaced by his son — a request to which the Pharaoh agrees. The philosopher then sets out the wisdom that he has gleaned over his long life, and that he wants to hand on to his son.\nPhilosophy Written when Ptahhotep was old and decidedly grumpy, the Maxims make for entertaining reading. Ptahhotep begins complaining about the miseries of old age. He grumbles that he forgets things all the time and \u0026lsquo;cannot recall even yesterday.\u0026rsquo; He says he no longer has any vigour, and has to nap all the time like a child. And he laments that all his previous pleasures have lost their savour. \u0026lsquo;Even standing and sitting are a bother!\u0026rsquo; he says.\nBut, he concedes, age comes with its benefits; and one of them is wisdom. So in the Maxims, he aims to communicate to his son what wisdom he has gleaned in his life and career. Because, after all, \u0026rsquo;no one is born wise.\u0026rsquo; And in the quest for wisdom, we need all the help that we can get.\nWisdom is always incomplete It is at this point that the Maxims get interesting. As such a high-ranking individual, Ptahhotep could have chosen to present himself as an authority. But instead, he goes in the other direction, and he calls authority itself into question.\nOld and grumpy as he is, Ptahhotep is sceptical when it comes to the possibilities of human attainment. \u0026lsquo;No one has ever attained perfection of competence,\u0026rsquo; he says. \u0026lsquo;And there is no craftsman who has acquired (full) mastery.\u0026rsquo; In other words, we all are (and always have been) at best semi-competent at this business of living; the mastery that we crave is always just out of reach.\nThis makes Ptahhotep a sceptic about the wisdom of those who claim to be wise. And in this, he resembles Socrates who lived two millennia later. But — unlike Socrates — Ptahhotep also recognises that there is such a thing as wisdom to be found among his contemporaries, and that this wisdom can be found in surprising places. Good advice, he says, \u0026lsquo;is rarer than emeralds,\u0026rsquo; and these emeralds of good advice can be found not just among priests and scribes, but also among those who are unlearned, and among \u0026lsquo;women at their grindstones.\u0026rsquo; Within the patriarchal society of Ancient Egypt, this is a strong claim.\nMa\u0026rsquo;at: the foundations of ethics Reading the Maxims of Ptahhotep, you get a sense of a real, human voice trying to make sense of the world, and trying to navigate through complications of human life. And if Ptahhotep\u0026rsquo;s advice often seems rather home-spun, it is underpinned by a larger idea: the idea that the universe runs on moral principles.\nFor Ptahhotep, the moral order of the universe is guaranteed by the goddess Ma\u0026rsquo;at, the embodiment of harmony and social order. It is Ma\u0026rsquo;at who brought order to the world after its creation; and she is the one who is responsible for maintaining this order, preventing the world from sliding back into primordial chaos.\nThe name Ma\u0026rsquo;at literally means \u0026lsquo;base\u0026rsquo;, like the base of a throne. The historian Norman Cohn writes that Ma\u0026rsquo;at was \u0026lsquo;a principle of order so all-embracing that it governed every aspect of existence.\u0026rsquo; For Ptahhotep, Ma\u0026rsquo;at is the foundation-stone and guarantor of the moral order of the world.\nPtahhotep argues for a moral universe. But this presents him with an obvious problem. If the universe is moral, how is it the case that self-interest seems to lead to gain and profit? Ptahhotep\u0026rsquo;s response to this problem holds fast to the idea of a moral order to the universe, but is not entirely convincing. He argues that such gains are only ever short-term. What those who do immoral acts don\u0026rsquo;t realise is that ultimately \u0026lsquo;wrongdoing does not result in success\u0026rsquo;; because, he writes, \u0026lsquo;in the long run it is Ma\u0026rsquo;at which endures.\u0026rsquo;\nAdvice for living The Maxims are full of advice about how to manage our lives in accord with this moral order, both individually and in relationship to others. Ptahhotep advises us not to work too much. What is important in human life is \u0026rsquo;the time of following the heart.\u0026rsquo; And when we accumulate wealth for its own sake — beyond what we need to keep our \u0026lsquo;household in order\u0026rsquo; — we squander this time of following the heart, and this squandering is an \u0026lsquo;annoyance of spirit.\u0026rsquo;\nFollow your heart as long as you live,And do not work beyond what is allocated (to you).Do not waste the time of following the heart,For wasting time is an annoyance of the spirit. — The Maxims of Ptahhotep.\nAs for our relationships with others, Ptahhotep is preoccupied with how to manage our interpersonal difficulties: in particular how to engage in disputes without leading to their escalation, and how to manage destructive anger.\nBut Ptahhotep\u0026rsquo;s recommendations are also rooted in a keen awareness of how flawed our knowledge of others is. This is a consequence of the fact that none of us ever attain full competence in any domain. Ptahhotep takes as an example somebody who is childless. In Ancient Egypt, it was important to have descendants. But Ptahhotep reminds his readers, \u0026lsquo;it is common that a father may be in misery, / And as for a mother who has given birth, another may be happier than she.\u0026rsquo;\nOur judgements about others, and how well or badly their lives are going, may be wide of the mark. And we are wrong precisely because of the things we think we know about the world, or because we assume that we have expertise that we do not have.\nThe long search for wisdom Ptahhotep\u0026rsquo;s Maxims remind us that the long search for wisdom reaches back far into our shared past. And the fact that one of humanity\u0026rsquo;s first named philosophers was from Africa offers a challenge to ethnocentric notions that restrict the practice of philosophy to only a few cultures: because, as Ptahhotep tells us, the emeralds of wisdom can be found everywhere.\nFurther Reading Books Norman Cohn\u0026rsquo;s discussion of Ma\u0026rsquo;at can be found in his book Cosmos, Chaos, and the World to Come (Yale University Press 1993)\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a beautifully clear translation of the Maxims of Ptahhotep in Literature of Ancient Egypt: An Anthology, __ edited by William Kelly Simpson (Yale University Press 2003)\nOnline Resources You can read extracts from the Maxims on the UCL website.\nFor a more meaty philosophical discussion of Ptahhotep, see this paper by Joan Mulholland, exploring the Maxims through conversation analysis.\n",

            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Aspasia was born to a high-ranking family in the town of Miletus (where Thales was also born) around 470 BCE. Details of her early life are hazy, and many of the accounts we have are unreliable; but it is likely that some time around 450 BCE she moved to Athens, fleeing political unrest. In Athens, she was classified as a resident alien, and lacked the rights of a citizen.\nThe Philosopher-Courtesan It is possible that in Athens Aspasia worked as a hetaira — a high-class female companion to powerful men. The role of the hetaira was not just to provide sex, but also intellectual companionship, conversation and emotional support. This meant that many hetairai were among the most highly educated women in Athens, and some gained considerable wealth and political power. But as with all accounts of women philosophers in history, we would do well to take claims like this with some scepticism: they may be reflections of the truth; but equally, they may be the attempts of later writers to discredit women philosophers.\nComing back to more solid historical ground, it is clear that once she was in Athens, Aspasia entered into a long-term relationship with the statesman and military general Pericles. As Aspasia was an outsider, they could not have their union recognised in law, so it was not a legal marriage. Nevertheless, Aspasia’s long-standing relationship with Pericles may have given her a degree of protection, and access to Athenian high society. This is how she came into contact with the philosopher Socrates, who — according to the account left by Plato — regarded her as his teacher.\nA Controversial Figure If one thing is clear from contemporary accounts, it is that Aspasia was a controversial figure, as was her relationship with Pericles. Both she and Pericles were often the object of criticism and attack. The playwright Aristophanes even went as far as to blame her — without a shred of evidence — for the outbreak of the Peloponnesian war.\nIn the year 429 BCE, plague swept through Athens. Pericles watched many of his family-members die, and then he too succumbed.\nAfter the death of Pericles, Aspasia continued to live in Athens. But it seems that after her partner’s death, she was further away from the centres of power. Our knowledge about her later life is as uncertain and fuzzy as the knowledge we have of her early life. It is likely that she died around the year 401 BCE, a couple of years before the death of Socrates.\nPhilosophy Aspasia was famous chiefly as a rhetorician. Rhetoric is — as Aristotle later argued — the art of observing \u0026lsquo;in any given case the available means of persuasion.\u0026rsquo; And according to the tradition, Aspasia was such a compellingly persuasive speaker that she taught both Pericles the great military general, and Socrates the great philosopher, how to speak persuasively, and how to win others over. In Plato’s dialogue called the Menexenus, Socrates says, \u0026lsquo;I happen to have no mean teacher of oratory\u0026rsquo; — and that teacher was Aspasia.\nReason and Persuasion In Ancient Greece, the idea of rhetoric was always under suspicion. And a female rhetorician was perhaps doubly suspect. The argument against rhetoric was that if we are skilled enough, we can persuade people of anything — whether it is true or not — and so rhetoric is at best an ambivalent tool, and at worst a genuine threat to reasoned debate. But the counter-argument — one that is made by Aristotle as well — is that rhetoric is an important skill, one that supplements our search for truth. If you know something to be true, but are incapable of persuading others, then it is hard for this knowledge to be put to use. In this second view, rhetoric is essential to public reason and debate. Truth is useless if we cannot persuade anybody of the truth.\nAnd if Aspasia was indeed the Socrates\u0026rsquo;s teacher in rhetoric, it is clear that she was successful: Plato\u0026rsquo;s dialogues provide ample evidence of Socrates\u0026rsquo;s enormously persuasive style of debate and argumentation.\nHidden Histories But the story of Aspasia also reminds us of the often hidden role played by women in the philosophical traditions of the world. The sheer difficulty we have when it comes to getting her story straight (in contrast, we know a whole load about Pericles!) is a consequence of the way that women’s voices have often been distorted and excluded from the tradition.\nFurther Reading Books The most complete historical account of Aspasia — the person and the many myths — can be found in Prisoner of History: Aspasia of Miletus and Her Biographical Tradition by Madeleine M. Henry (Oxford University Press 1995)\nOnline Resources There is a good entry on Aspasia on the Ancient History Encyclopedia.\nThere’s a fascinating piece on the Conversation by Armand D’Angour, exploring the influence of women philosophers on the direction of Socrates’s philosophy. D’Angour argues (spoiler alert!) that Diotima and Aspasia were one and the same. I’m not 100% convinced, but it’s a fun read. The link is here. If you want to read the full argument, the book is Socrates in Love: The Making of a Philosopher (Bloomsbury 2019).\nImage: The Debate of Socrates and Aspasia, c. 1800.

Diotima appears as a character in Plato’s Symposium, where Socrates refers to her as “a woman of Mantinea—a woman who was wise in many things.” And our knowledge of her doesn’t extend far beyond this.\nDiotima’s name means “honoured by Zeus.” Her name suggests that she was a priestess, and according to Plato’s Symposium, she was also a philosopher and one of Socrates’s teachers. This would put her life in the fifth century before the common era.\nFiction and History Because the only contemporary account that mentions her is Plato’s, doubt has been cast on her historicity. Nevertheless, there is now an increasing agreement that the balance of evidence suggests she was indeed a real person. And as the philosopher Zoi Alliozi has argued, “fictional or not, her voice had a powerful influence on the arguments made by Socrates and therefore the history of philosophy as we know it.” Even fictional philosophers can have an influence on future generations.\nPhilosophy There are two ideas attributed to Diotima in the Symposium that have had an influence on the direction of Greek philosophy. The first is her distinctive teachings on love, and the second is her idea of metaxy or the “in-between”.\nThe Art of Love In the Symposium, Plato says that Diotima taught Socrates “the art of love” — an ambiguous phrase. As she was teaching him this art, Socrates made the claim that love was a great and powerful god. Diotima challenged him. Socrates was astonished by the challenge: but surely, he protested, love can’t be mortal. Diotima conceded the point, but then she said something interesting. Love, she argued, is neither immortal nor mortal, but somewhere in between. Love is an intermediary because it binds together the mortal and the immortal, and this is why love has the power to lead mortals to more enduring truths.\nIn the Symposium, this idea is developed through the image of a ladder of love. First, we might love an individual body. Through this love, we come to recognise that all bodies are worthy of love. And through recognising this, we begin to see that all souls are worthy of love. After this, we see that the social institutions and customs that are put in place by those with loveable souls are themselves worthy of love (this move from talking about the soul to talking about public institutions always strikes me as quite odd). Next, we come to see that knowledge itself is something we should love. And finally — at the top of the ladder — we end up loving love itself.\nThe In-Between One reason that Plato is interested in this is because it says something about philosophy. After all, philosophy is the love of wisdom. And the fact that philosophy is not wisdom, but instead the love of wisdom, makes it an intermediary between knowledge and ignorance.\nIn the story in the Symposium, Diotima asks Socrates if anything exists that occupies the middle position between knowledge and ignorance. At first Socrates can’t think of anything. But then Diotima proposes judgement as something that sits in this in-between position. Judgement is not knowledge because when we judge something to be true, this isn\u0026rsquo;t the same as knowing it to be true. But judgement is not ignorance either because good judgement often hits the mark of truth, “and how could what hits the truth be ignorance?”\nPhilosophy, like judgement, may be not quite the same as wisdom; but neither is it full-blown ignorance. It is wise, after all, to want to become wise. So anybody who wants to become wise cannot be totally ignorant. But if you want to become wise, by definition you are not yet wise. So you are between ignorance and wisdom, or ignorance and knowledge, driven by love to become wiser.\n“In that case, Diotima, who are the people who love wisdom, if they are neither wise nor ignorant?”“That’s obvious,” she said. “A child could tell you. Those who love wisdom fall in between those two extremes\u0026hellip;” —Plato, Symposium\nDiotima\u0026rsquo;s idea of the in-between, or metaxy wasn’t limited just to ignorance and wisdom. She called into question all kinds of binary oppositions, including between good and evil, beautiful and ugly, divine and mortal. Given how little we have to go on, it is hard to fully reconstruct Diotima\u0026rsquo;s philosophy; but it seems that for her most of the interesting stuff happens in these in-between spaces, in the middle-ground. And the kinds of distinctions that philosophers make between good and evil ignore how connected and entangled these oppositions are.\nSignals Through the Wall The 20th Century Catholic philosopher, Simone Weil, uses a metaphor to explain this idea of metaxy. She says in her book Gravity and Grace that \u0026lsquo;Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them, but it is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and God. Every separation is a link\u0026hellip; the essence of created things is to be intermediaries.\u0026rsquo;\nHowever, we make sense of this idea of metaxy, it is a reminder that our human lives are often complex and fuzzy, and experience maps badly onto boundaries like good/bad, beautiful/ugly, wise/ignorant and so on. Diotima reminds us that most of the interesting stuff happens in the places in-between.\nFurther Resources Books Zoi Alliozi’s piece appears in the brilliant The Philosopher Queens, edited by Rebecca Buxton and Lisa Whiting (Unbound Books 2020).\nThere’s a great essay on Diotima, and on the case for her as an historical individual, in chapter six of A History of Women Philosophers: Volume 1 Ancient Women Philosophers 600 B.C. — 500 A.D. edited by Mary Ellen Waithe (University of Minnesota Press 1987).\nSimone Weil\u0026rsquo;s Gravity and Grace is published in English by Routledge (2002).\nPlato\u0026rsquo;s Symposium is available in multiple editions, as well as online.\nOnline Resources There’s a brief post over on the History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps asking “Was Diotima Real, and Does it Matter?”\nThe BBC has a nice video on Diotima’s ladder.\nImage: The Polish poet and novelist Jadwiga Łuszczewska, posing as Diotima.

            "title": "Cultivating Ritual with Confucius",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life The traditional dates for Confucius’s life are between 551 and 479 BCE. This makes him the contemporary of Greek philosophers like Heraclitus and Anaxagoras. He was born in the small state of Lu, now in present-day China. Confucius’s ancestors were high-ranking, but his father died when he was young, and Confucius was brought up in relative poverty.\nIn his early adulthood, Confucius served in various offices in the court of Lu. According to one account, he was for a while in charge of rituals; and this may be reflected in his lifelong interest in the importance of ritual for social life. According to other accounts, he was also put in charge of granaries: an important function in a small state that relied on adequate supplies of food for its survival.\nLooking Back, Looking Forwards Confucius spent his life looking backward to a lost past and looking forward to a hoped-for future. Chinese history has been marked by alternating periods of fragmentation and unity: the famous 14th century Chinese novel The Romance of the Three Kingdoms begins with the words, \u0026lsquo;It is said that this is the great tendency of the world: long divided, it must unite; long united, it must divide.\u0026rsquo; Confucius lived in a period of fragmentation and division; and he looked back to the greatness of the Western Zhou dynasty (1050-771 BCE) as a period of unity, virtue and good governance.\nBut Confucius was not just nostalgic for the past. He was also optimistic about the future, and he looked forward in the hope that it might be possible to re-establish this lost order among the fragmented states of his day.\nPrinciples and Politics In a famous story retold by the historian Sima Qian (c. 145 — c. 186 BCE) — who as a writer is always entertaining, but not always to be trusted — Confucius left his official post after losing faith in the Duke of Lu. The story told by Sima Qian is that the ruler of the rival state of Qi was worried the state of Lu was becoming too powerful. To distract the Duke of Lu from the reforms he was putting in place, the ruler of Qi sent him eighty courtesans and a hundred horses as a distraction. The duke’s head was easily turned. He shut himself away with the women and gave himself over to pleasure. Confucius was disgusted by the duke’s neglect of his responsibilities, choosing self-imposed exile over a dissolute employer.\nPhilosophy Confucius’s philosophy can be frustrating to make sense of, because based on his recorded teachings, it can seem on first acquaintance to be both somehow intangible and also all-encompassing. There is none of the close argument that you find in Plato or Aristotle, for example. Not only this, but Confucius has become so centrally important for philosophy in East Asia, his thought has been continually reinterpreted for around two and a half thousand years.\nBut one way of getting hold of the core of Confucius’s thinking is to see him as a relentlessly and deeply social thinker. He was a philosopher who was concerned not with human beings in isolation, but instead with the ways that we interact, the ways that we come together to form functional, or dysfunctional, societies.\nTwo of the key ideas in Confucius’s Analects or collected saying are that of ren (仁), or fellow-feeling, and li (禮), or ritual.\nBetween Ourselves The word ren causes problems for Confucius’s translators to other languages. It is a term that appears absolutely everywhere in Confucius\u0026rsquo;s work. But it is hard to find exact equivalents in English. The Chinese character ren (仁) is made up of the character for \u0026lsquo;person\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;human being\u0026rsquo; (ren or 人), and the character for \u0026rsquo;two\u0026rsquo; (in modern Mandarin Chinese, er, or 二). So you could see ren as the optimal interpersonal relationship, the ideal way we should relate to each other. Some people translate ren into English as \u0026lsquo;humaneness\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;humanity\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;benevolence\u0026rsquo;, but I prefer to think of it as something like \u0026rsquo;the ideal way of being and acting with others.\u0026rsquo;\nFor Confucius, ren is the knowledge that at the deepest level, we are not singular, but we exist in relationship to others. So it is better to think of ren not as something to which we aspire, but as something to which we can always return home. In one passage in the Analects, Confucius asks rhetorically, \u0026lsquo;Is ren far away?’ And then he answers his own question by saying, \u0026lsquo;If I wish for ren, then ren is there!\u0026rsquo; In other words, we can read Confucius as saying that our deepest nature is that we are social beings. Because this is who we are, it is something with which we can always reconnect.\nRitual The other idea that is important to Confucius is the idea of ritual or li (禮). The Chinese character represents an offering made before an altar. But for Confucius, ritual isn’t just a matter of religious ceremonies. Instead, it is something that pervades all life.\nConfucius sees li as something that grows out of, and also sustains, the fellow-feeling of ren. In the Analects, Confucius asks:\nIf you are human, but don’t have ren, what purpose is there in ritual?\nThis is an idea that takes a bit of unpacking. One reason modern readers sometimes stumble over this is that in many cultures, ritual has quite a poor reputation. We can think of ritual as something cold, stilted and awkward, something that is the opposite of that warm, mutual connection between human beings.\nBut for Confucius, ritual is a conduit for feeling. In the Analects, Confucius wrote, \u0026lsquo;When undertaking ritual, take harmony as what is most valuable.\u0026rsquo; Think of how you offer a friend a cup of tea, or how you bring over a bottle of wine, or a bunch of flowers, when you are invited for dinner. These are all ritualised gestures. But they don’t feel forced or strained. Instead, they open up a pathway to a deeper, more harmonious connection between you.\nSo what Confucius is saying is this: if we care about how to live together as best we can, then we need to be able to cultivate shared practices of ritual to ensure that our collective lives are harmonious. Ritual is like the music of our shared lives. And when we can play in harmony, then life is good!\nFurther Resources Books The lunyu is the collected saying of Confucius. It is known in English as The Analects, and there are multiple translations available. There’s a good online translation by Charles Muller that is free to access.\nIf you want a good, readable translation of the Analects, then try Edward Slingerland\u0026rsquo;s Analects: With Selections from Traditional Commentaries (Hackett 2010). It is both scholarly and approachable.\nFor an interesting philosophical take, try David Hall and Roger Ames\u0026rsquo;s Thinking Through Confucius (SUNY Press 1987). Another old-but-good book is Herbert Fingarette\u0026rsquo;s Confucius: The Secular as Sacred (Waveland Press 1998), which is a fascinating study of the role ritual plays in human life.\nFor an introduction to the influence of Confucius throughout history, Daniel Gardner\u0026rsquo;s Confucianism: A Very Short Introduction (OUP 2014) is a good place to start.\nOnline Resources National Geographic has an article on the continued relevance of Confucius.\nWatch this very short BBC video on Confucius, and why we should honour our ancestors.

            "title": "Thales of Miletus on Appearance and Reality",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Thales of Miletus was born some time around 624 BCE. His birthplace, Miletus, was an important trading port in the Greek world, now on the coast of Turkey. And if Thales is credited with being the first philosopher in Ancient Greece, it is no surprise that he lived in a busy trading town. As strangers met in Miletus, they no doubt argued about their different world views as they looked for common ground to communicate and trade. So Miletus was a natural place for the beginnings of philosophy, which attempts to think about the world more universally.\nNo writings by Thales remain, if he ever wrote at all. And we don’t know much about his life. But in the stories that later writers tell about him, he appears as a man who paid close attention to the world. He was said to have predicted eclipses, to have discovered electricity by rubbing a piece of amber, and to have been fascinated by magnets. His experiments with electricity and with magnets led him to conclude that all things have a soul, even inanimate things.\n\u0026ldquo;Thales gave inanimate things too a share in soul, taking his evidence from the magnetic stone and from amber.\u0026rdquo; — Diogenes Laertius\nWorldly and unworldly philosophers In many stories about Thales, he seems very worldly and practical. In one story, told by Aristotle, one year Thales predicted a bumper olive harvest, based on his meteorological observations. Realising that the conditions were going to be perfect for olives that year, he reserved the use of all the olive presses in Miletus in advance, and made a fortune on renting the presses back out when the harvest came in. According to Aristotle, this was no get-rich-quick scheme. Instead, Thales simply wanted to show that philosophy had a practical use.\nIn other stories, Thales seems less worldly. One tale — popularised by Aesop in his Fables — says that he was so busy staring up at the heavens, he fell down a well. True or not, it shows that jokes about unworldly philosophers are as old as philosophy itself.\nTraditional accounts say that Thales died around the age of 70, of heat-stroke whilst watching the Olympic Games.\nPhilosophy Thales is significant because he broke with mythological or theological explanations of why the world is the way it is, resorting instead to naturalistic explanations. In doing so, he made a split between how things appear to be (\u0026lsquo;appearances\u0026rsquo;), and how things actually are (\u0026lsquo;reality\u0026rsquo;), arguing that to understand the complexity of the world, we need to look to simpler, more basic underlying principles beneath. This division between appearances and reality became central to the traditions that stemmed from Greek philosophy. For example, when Socrates asked about ethics, he wanted to drill down to find the deeper principles that lurked beneath the everyday phenomena of ethics. He wanted to find out not just about this or that act of justice or injustice, but what justice was in itself.\nFrom myth to naturalism In the perspective of Greek mythology, the world is subject to the lawless whims of the gods. The desires of the gods are changeable, capricious and impossible to anticipate. In a world ruled by the gods, it is anybody\u0026rsquo;s guess what is going to happen next. There is no way of predicting an olive harvest: these things just happen. But if the world is underpinned by natural laws and principles, then it becomes possible to understand the world more deeply by understanding these laws and principles.\nAppearance and reality The idea that the complexity of the world is underpinned by simpler reality leaves us with a problem: what is this underlying essence or reality? This was a topic for considerable debate among ancient Greek philosophers. Thales, who was the first to ask this question, concluded that the underlying reality was water. After all, water is changeable. Life depends on it. And as Thales lived by the shores of the Mediterranean, water was pretty much everywhere.\nFor there must be some nature, whether one or more than one, from which other things come to be, while this nature is preserved. [The philosophers] do not all agree, however, on the number and kind of such a starting-oint. Thales, the one who started this sort of philosophy, says it is water (because of this, he also declared that the earth rests on water), perhaps reaching this supposition from seeing that the nourishment for all things is moist\u0026hellip; — Aristotle, Metaphysics\nThales was wrong, of course. But this method of understanding the world has persisted down to the present day. And contemporary scientists, just like Thales, continue to work by seeking out the simpler principles behind complex things.\nFurther Reading Books One of the best collections of sources for early Greek philosophy is The Presocratic Philosophers, by Jonathan Barnes (Routledge 1982).\nCatherine Osborne’s Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford University Press 2004) is a thought-provoking but easy-to-read exploration of Thales and other early Greek thinkers.\nOnline Resources Try the always reliable Ancient History Encyclopedia for more on Thales: https://www.ancient.eu/Thales_of_Miletus/.

            "title": "Socrates, Philosophical Trouble-Maker",
            "tags": ["Philosopher Files",],
            "content": "Life Socrates (c.470 BCE — 399 BCE) was born in Athens, the son of a stonemason and a midwife. It is likely he worked for a time in the family business as a stonemason himself. He also undertook military service during the Peloponnesian War — perhaps one of the few times he travelled far from Athens.\nHis philosophical education was informal. He studied with the philosopher Anaxagoras. And according to his disciple Plato, he was also influenced by two women philosophers: Aspasia of Miletus, with whom he studied the arts of oratory; and the priestess Diotima of Mantinea. He was a philosopher who believed in the value of speech over writing, and consequently he never wrote anything; but his ideas were recorded and embellished by his disciples, including Xenophon and Plato.\nSocrates was a striking figure. Contemporary accounts describe him as squat, ugly and often blunt to the point of rudeness. He was also almost immune to physical hardship. He could endure heat, cold, hunger and thirst without seeming troubled. And he was famous also as a drinker: Socrates could drink almost anybody else under the table, and still remain standing.\nThe quest for wisdom Socrates was preoccupied by the idea of wisdom. According to an account in Plato’s Apology, the oracle of Apollo at Delphi once told Socrates’s childhood friend Chaerephon that nobody was wiser than Socrates. When Chaerephon told Socrates this, Socrates thought that this couldn’t be right because he knew that he wasn’t wise at all. So, he started going round, cross-examining people he met, to see if he could prove the oracle wrong. He spoke to philosophers, politicians, poets, and found that under close cross-examination, the so-called wise turned out to be ignorant after all.\nEventually, Socrates realised that nobody else knew much either: we are all blundering around in the dark. So Socrates concluded that perhaps the god Apollo was right: Socrates was wisest because he was the only person who had the wisdom to know that his wisdom didn’t amount to anything.\nDeath of a trouble-maker Unsurprisingly, Socrates made himself unpopular going around and causing trouble like this. When he was around the age of 70, he was prosecuted on trumped-up charges, and sentenced to death by drinking poison. Although he was given the opportunity to escape, he insisted on seeing the sentence through. Having benefited from the laws of the city all his life, he argued, he shouldn’t try to escape them when it suited him.\nPhilosophy Socrates was not the first philosopher in Ancient Greece. But he is so important for the development of philosophy in the West that the Greek philosophers who preceded him are all often lumped together as \u0026lsquo;pre-Socratic\u0026rsquo; philosophers. He put in place a new style of philosophical analysis and argumentation. He put ethics at the heart of philosophical enquiry. And he raised questions about the body and the soul (or the mind) that would become central to the Western traditions of philosophy.\nCross-examination Socrates is important in the history of philosophy because he was the first to argue that claims — particularly ethical or moral claims — should be subjected to rigorous cross-examination. This cross-examination (or elenchus, as it is called) is a way of testing the truth or falsity of the things that we believe to be true. The purpose of the elenchus may be to find out the truth of the matter. But it may equally be to undermine our certainty about the truths that we hold to, and to provoke a more questioning, curious attitude to the things that we take for granted.\nEssence and ethics One of the first Greek philosophers was Thales of Miletus (c.625 BCE — c. 546 BCE), who had the insight that behind the complex phenomena of the physical world, behind there might be simpler, underlying principles or essences. Or that there’s a difference between appearances — how things seem to be — and the underlying reality.\nSocrates took this idea and applied it to ethics. When he cross-examined people about things like \u0026lsquo;justice\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;piety\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;virtue\u0026rsquo;, he was seeking not just examples of these things, not just the appearances of ethics or morality. Instead, he was seeking to understand their underlying principles. He was asking what it is that makes something just, or pious, or virtuous.\nPhilosophy, Death and the Soul Another important claim that Plato attributes to Socrates is that the soul and the body are separable. Philosophy involves removing ourselves from bodily concerns, and turning towards the intellect. In this way, Socrates says in his death-bed speech in the Phaedo, philosophy is a way of preparing for death, when the body and soul will be irreversibly severed.\nFurther Reading Books For an alternative view of Socrates, where he is presented not as a great philosopher but instead as a figure of fun, read The Clouds by his contemporary, the playwright Aristophanes. It is lots of fun. One particularly readable version is Aristophanes 1: Clouds, Wasps, Birds, trans. Peter Meineck (Hackett 1998).\nIf you want to dive into translations of Greek texts, one of the best places to start is Plato’s The Apology, which gives an account of Socrates’s trial defence, and Phaedo, which tells the story of Socrates’s death. These are available in multiple versions. But try the Penguin Classics version, The Last Days of Socrates translated by Harold Tarrant (Penguin 2010).\nFor an overview of Socrates’s life and thought, try Socrates, A Very Short Introduction by C.C.W.
