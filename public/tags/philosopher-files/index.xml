      <description>There is perhaps no headache greater than that of being a head of state. Or, in fact, being the head of anything. From the ancient world to the present day, it has been recognised that to be a ruler is to be condemned to a life of constant vigilance. You have to spend your days on the look-out for plots and enemies. You have to keep an eye on the unfolding power-plays within your court.</description>

      <title>The Swoop and Surge of Life: Lucretius on Ethics in Motion</title>
      <link>https://www.lookingforwisdom.com/lucretius-ethics/</link>

      <description>Love, Strife and The Mad Machinery of War In his great poem, On the Nature of the Universe (De Rerum Natura), Roman poet-philosopher Lucretius (born c. 100 BCE) asks what it means to live fully in a world where everything is always in motion. A follower of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, Lucretius proposed that the universe was both dynamic and unstable. But as well as setting out a vision of physics, or how the world is, Lucretius also set out a compelling vision of what it means to live in such a world.</description>

      <description>The Philosopher and the Love Potion If you were to trust Saint Jerome – and you probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t – the philosopher and poet Titus Lucretius Carus, better known simply as Lucretius, met an unfortunate end. The philosopher-poet was born some time after 100 BCE, a Roman citizen, and he became a follower of the atomism of Democritus and the materialist teachings of Epicurus, who emphasised the role of pleasure in human life.</description>

      <description>The Many Voices of the Huainanzi In the year 139 BCE, Liu An (劉安 179-122 BCE), the scholarly-minded King of Huainan, wanted to ingratiate himself to his cousin once removed, the Emperor Wu of Han. So he did what any self-respecting scholar king would do. Anxious to demonstrate his usefulness and his political nous, he convened a group of scholars to put together a text on the art of leadership to present to the young emperor.</description>

      <title>Knowing, Doing, and Doubting: Nyāya Philosophy</title>

      <description>Texts and Woven Threads The tradition of Nyāya philosophy in India goes back to a text called the Nyāya-sūtra. It is one of the most extensive treatments of the art of reasoning to be found in early Indian philosophy.&#xA;The Nyāya-sūtra is a fascinating text, one that explores the relationship between knowing, practical action, and doubt. The various strands in the sūtra (the word “sūtra&amp;quot; सूत्र means “thread”) were probably brought together into something resembling the current form around 150 in the Common Era.</description>

      <description>Loneliness, Mortality and Terror Okay, folks! Strap in for an extended philosopher file, where we&amp;rsquo;re talking about fundamental problems in philosophy, why there may be no such things, what it might mean to approach philosophy more like an anthropologist, and how to redraw our maps of human life.&#xA;Several years ago, I attended an academic conference on philosophy. Some way through the conference, mid-afternoon, at the point when everybody was becoming a bit somnolent, I found myself in a half-empty university teaching room, my notebook in front of me.</description>

      <description>Chronicles and Caterpillars If there&amp;rsquo;s anything that we can predict with certainty about the course of history, it is that history is unpredictable. This is an insight that was central to the thought of the Chinese philosopher Dong Zhongshu (董仲舒).&#xA;Dong was born some time around 198 BCE in Guangchuan, now in present-day Hebei. What we know about his life comes from a couple of sources. First, a few scrappy references in the Shiji (史記) or Records of the Grand Historian, by the historian Sima Qian (司馬遷).</description>

      <description>The Soul and Other Long-standing Problems What is the soul? What is our innermost essence? What makes us, most deeply, who we are?&#xA;When faced by this question, the temptation is to go straight to our uniqueness. What makes me me is that I have unique, singular, specific qualities. This uniqueness and singularity is what is most deeply, and most fundamentally, who I am.&#xA;But for the Indian philosopher Kaṇāda, the opposite is true.</description>

      <description>Learning to Play At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m endeavouring to improve my rudimentary jazz piano playing. It&amp;rsquo;s a long process: I&amp;rsquo;ve played on and off for years, without really getting any better. So this year, now I&amp;rsquo;ve been reunited with my keyboard, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to put some more time in, hoping that I can make some small, incremental improvements. It&amp;rsquo;s fun, fascinating and sometimes frustrating.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot to learn: all that theory, that experience of listening to music, that feeling of what the music is like in your bones.</description>

      <title>The Charisma of No-Charisma: Han Fei, Law, and the Art of Politics</title>

      <description>Philosophy in times of strife The Chinese Legalist philosopher Han Fei (韓非) (281-233 BCE) was born a member of the royal household in the small state of Han. What we know about Han Fei comes from the unreliable Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian. The stories may not be entirely trustworthy, but we do know that the context of Han Fei&amp;rsquo;s life was one of the political strife that marked the centuries known in China as the Warring States period (dating from 476 to 221 BCE).</description>

      <title>Renegade Philosophers, and the Art of Changing Your Mind</title>
      <link>https://www.lookingforwisdom.com/renegade-philosophers/</link>

      <guid>https://www.lookingforwisdom.com/renegade-philosophers/</guid>
      <description>Does philosophy change our minds? Philosophers talk a lot about the power of reasoned argument to change our minds. The whole discipline of philosophy, to an extent, depends on the idea that this is how argument works.&#xA;But there&amp;rsquo;s a problem with this idea. Because one thing that you notice if you hang around philosophers for a while is that in practice, they don&amp;rsquo;t change their minds very often. Surely, one might think, if reasoned debate were really this transformative, then their skill in the use of reason would lead to them changing their minds with a quicksilver frequency that would put the rest of us to shame.</description>

      <description>The philosophical alchemist The philosopher Zou Yan (鄒衍) lived between 305 and 240CE. He is associated with the so-called Yin Yang School (yinyang jia 陰陽家), also sometimes referred to as the school of Chinese naturalism.&#xA;What biographical information we have about Zou Yan comes from Sima Qian&amp;rsquo;s Shiji or Records of the Grand Historian. The Shiji says that Zou Yan came from the state of Qi. His written output was considerable, and it encompassed everything from geography and natural history to history and philosophy.</description>

      <title>Sounds Plausible? The Philosophy of Carneades</title>

      <description>Obsession and self-medication The philosopher Carneades was born in Cyrene, home of the Cyrenaic philosophers, sometime around 214 BCE. Like many philosophers of his day in the Greek-speaking world, he moved to Athens so he could further his studies.&#xA;Contemporary accounts of Carneades paint him as an obsessive, single-minded type. He was so engrossed by his studies that he didn&amp;rsquo;t cut his nails or his hair, and he had to be persuaded to eat, because otherwise he would simply forget.</description>

      <description>Killed by an elephant The philosopher Jaimini is an obscure figure. We know almost nothing about him, other than the story – which may or may not be true – that he was killed by a rampaging elephant. But beyond this, the records are silent.&#xA;Although he is known as the founder of the mīmāṃsā philosophical school, we don&amp;rsquo;t even know which century Jaimini lived in. The best guest for a date for the Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra, the foundational text of the mīmāṃsā philosophical tradition attributed to Jaimini, is sometime around 200 BCE, although some scholars date it to a couple of centuries earlier.</description>

Born in 1931 to Tswana and Xhosa parents, he studied theology in London before returning to his native South Africa, where he became a powerful voice in the fight against apartheid.</description>

      <title>Getting Smart About Pleasure: The Philosophy of Epicurus</title>

      <description>Taking pleasure seriously The Greek philosopher Epicurus is a philosopher most often associated with hedonism, the idea that the good life is a life where we should seek to maximise our pleasure. This might conjure up images of wild excess, or endless drug-fuelled orgies. And this, in fact, is how Epicurus&amp;rsquo;s opponents sometimes represented his philosophy and his community of followers. But Epicurus&amp;rsquo;s own approach to living pleasurably was more sedate than his critics imagined.</description>

      <description>The puzzle of gift-giving It&amp;rsquo;s the time of year when, for those of us who live in countries and communities where Christmas is celebrated, we face the prospect of an explosion of gift exchange. This gift-giving raises all kinds of practical issues (as we asked in the last philosopher file, what do you get a man like Uncle Pedro?). But it is also philosophically puzzling. Why do we do it? What&amp;rsquo;s going on in this frenzy of giving and receiving gifts?</description>

      <description>So, in those countries where Christmas is celebrated, it&amp;rsquo;s getting to that time of year when the eternal philosophical problem presents itself: *what should I get as a gift for Uncle Pedro?&#xA;Last year&amp;rsquo;s socks didn&amp;rsquo;t go down well: he didn&amp;rsquo;t wear them even once. Then there was the debacle with the chocolate (how had you never known that Uncle Pedro was allergic to cocoa beans)? As for the six-volume boxed set of Proust that you bought him, he hasn&amp;rsquo;t even cracked the spine on the first volume.</description>

      <title>Chrysippus on How to Manage Our Emotions</title>

      <description>The philosopher who couldn&amp;rsquo;t hold his drink Chrysippus was born sometime around 279 BCE in the town of Soli, now on the southern coast of Turkey. Diogenes Laërtius says that Chrysippus first trained as a long-distance runner, but eventually, he came to Athens and became fascinated by Stoicism. He became a follower of Cleanthes (c. 330 — c. 230 BC), himself a disciple of Zeno of Citium, and when Cleanthes died, Chrysippus took over as head of the Stoic school.</description>

      <description>Ritual is a Creative Act This is the second in a two-part series on ritual. In the first piece, we looked at how ritual helps us get by, sometimes almost magically, in a complicated social world (you can read part one of this series here).&#xA;But ritual is more than just a way of getting by. It is also a way of giving shape to ourselves and our shared world. To engage in ritual is to engage in a creative act that can transform the world.</description>

      <description>Looking at the overlooked Sometimes, the most philosophically interesting things in human life are those things that are so close to us, we overlook their importance. So in the next couple of pieces here in Looking for Wisdom, I&amp;rsquo;m going to explore one of these philosophically interesting, but often hidden, topics: and that topic is ritual.&#xA;When we hear the word “ritual”, what often comes to mind is something pretty elaborate, involving fancy outfits, the recitation of obscure texts, long robes, even longer faces, and altars fragrant with incense.</description>

      <description>Cultural connections The philosopher Pyrrho (c. 360 — c. 270 BCE) was born in Elis in Western Greece. Much of what we know about him is hearsay, deriving from the somewhat breathless accounts of his student and all-round biggest philosophical fan, Timon of Phlius. Timon&amp;rsquo;s stories, whether true or not, were later taken up by the biographer Diogenes Laërtius. Diogenes supplemented Timon&amp;rsquo;s admiring accounts with some intriguing tales about Pyrrho&amp;rsquo;s eccentricities taken from the writer Antigonus of Carystus.</description>

      <description>Living the Cynic Life Somewhere between a philosopher, a comedian, and an activist, Hipparchia of Maroneia was one of the most significant early philosophers in the Cynic school founded by Diogenes. She was born some time around 350 BCE in the Thracian village of Maroneia, but when she was still young, she moved with her family to Athens. Her background was privileged and wealthy. However, along with her brother Metrocles, once in Athens, she became involved with the Cynic philosophers.</description>

      <description>The first Stoic Zeno of Citium—not to be confused with Zeno of Elea—was the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy. In recent years, Stoicism has seen a huge resurgence, both as an area of academic interest, and also as a popular philosophy offering guidance in our everyday lives. But how did it all begin?&#xA;Life Zeno (334-262 BCE) came from the city of Citium in Cyprus, but like many philosophers of his day, he eventually ended up in Athens, the intellectual hub of the ancient Greek world.</description>

      <description>A This-Worldly Philosophy In popular culture, there can be a tendency to see Indian philosophical traditions as somehow inherently spiritual, and to contrast this supposedly mystical East with a rational West. But this division of the world into a rational West and a mystical East maps poorly onto the facts. Much philosophy in the West, from Plato and Socrates onwards, is tangled up with various forms of mysticism, and with a preoccupation with the divine.</description>

What&amp;rsquo;s the point of doing what we are doing? What&amp;rsquo;s the point of our lives? What&amp;rsquo;s the point of human life in general?&#xA;When we ask ourselves these questions, we are not just idly speculating about life. Instead, these are questions that we feel deeply and intensely. They have an existential weight behind them.</description>

      <description>Life Aristotle is one of the most influential of all philosophers in the Greek tradition. He was Plato&amp;rsquo;s most famous student, but he ended up rejecting many of Plato&amp;rsquo;s central ideas, in particular his theory of forms. And he was a formative influence not only on the philosophical traditions of Europe but also on those of the Islamic world.&#xA;However, if the ancient biographer Diogenes Laërtius is to be believed (which, alas, he isn&amp;rsquo;t always), Aristotle was quite a curious individual.</description>

      <description>Life Hui Shi (c. 370 — c. 310 BCE) was a Chinese philosopher known for his fascination with logical puzzles. He is considered as a representative of the School of Names, or in Chinese ming jia (see the philosopher file on Deng Xi). Hui Shi is famous, in particular, for his puzzling paradoxes that seem to share some resemblances with those of Zeno of Elea.&#xA;As with so many figures in early Chinese thought, the historical Hui Shi is frustratingly elusive.</description>

      <description>Plato&amp;rsquo;s so-called &amp;rsquo;theory of forms&amp;rsquo; is one of the most enduringly strange parts of his philosophy. It is also one of the main centres of gravity around which Plato&amp;rsquo;s work turns. So in the second part of our two-part philosopher file on Plato, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at this theory in more depth.&#xA;If you want more background information on Plato, you can go to part one and read the piece there.</description>

      <description>Life Like Confucius and Mencius before him, it is said that the Confucian philosopher Xun Kuang, or Xunzi (c. 310 – 235 BCE), was an itinerant advisor to kings and rulers.&#xA;Not much is known about his early life. But there are indications that in his later years as a political advisor, he had more success than both Mencius and Confucius. He was appointed to several high positions, before eventually retiring from public life and living out the remainder of his years far from the intrigues of politics.</description>

      <description>The Aztecs and Philosophy Who were the Aztecs? The people now usually called the Aztecs were a Nahuatl-speaking people from Central Mexico. From the thirteenth century, their ancestors migrated from what is now Northern Mexico and the Southern United States to Mexico&amp;rsquo;s high central plateau. In the long political struggle for dominance that followed, the Aztecs eventually settled on a marshy, unprepossessing island in the middle of Lake Texcoco, where they began to build up a regional power base that became the foundation of one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest empires.</description>

      <description>Zhuangzi: The Philosopher and the Text Zhuangzi (sometimes written Chuang Tzu), or Master Zhuang, is the name given to the philosopher Zhuang Zhou, who lived in China sometime between 369 and 286 BCE. The book that takes the philosopher&amp;rsquo;s name, the Zhuangzi, is almost certainly the work of several hands. And although the book doesn&amp;rsquo;t present a coherent viewpoint, it does have an overarching mood: a free-wheeling, almost anarchistic blend of humour and insight, one that may reflect the character of the historical Zhuang Zhou.</description>

      <description>Life Arete of Cyrene was born into a philosophically-inclined family. Her father, Aristippus of Cyrene (c. 430 – 356 BCE), founded a distinctive philosophical school, known as the Cyrenaics, named after his home town, near Shahhat in present-day Libya.&#xA;We know slightly more about Aristippus than we do about his daughter Arete. He travelled to Athens when he was still a young man, and he became a part of the circle surrounding Socrates, although they had very different philosophical approaches.</description>

His estimated dates are either 372 – 289 BCE or 385 – c. 303 BCE.&#xA;Mencius&amp;rsquo;s given name was Meng Ke.

      <description>Life The great ventriloquist Plato was born in Athens some time between 428 and 423 BCE to a high-ranking Athenian family. Plato&amp;rsquo;s family took particular pride in being related to the great statesman Solon who lived two centuries before, and who put in place the laws that underpinned Athenian democracy.&#xA;Like many other philosophers in Ancient Greece, Plato wrote his philosophical works in a literary form. But where Parmenides and Xenophanes wrote in verse, Plato&amp;rsquo;s preferred form was dialogue.</description>

There, the two philosophers meet the young Socrates, upon whom Zeno makes a substantial impression. If Plato&amp;rsquo;s story is true, this would mean that Zeno was born some time around 490 BCE.</description>

      <description>Understanding the world The story of philosophy is the story of human attempts to understand the world of which we are a part, and to understand ourselves. But traditions of academic philosophy have tended to give greater weight to only a small handful of traditions — for example, Greek and European philosophy, Indian philosophy or Chinese philosophy.&#xA;But if philosophy is really about human attempts to understand the world, and to understand what it means to be human, then if we limit ourselves to a few traditions, we risk missing out on rich resources.</description>

But what is work? Why does it loom so large in our lives? And how can philosophy help throw more light on what work is, and why it matters?</description>

Leucippus is said to have authored two books: On Mind and The Great World System, neither of which has survived. Democritus was much more prolific and is said to have authored up to seventy works.&#xA;Between them, Leucippus and Democritus introduced a new idea into the Greek philosophical world: the idea that the things of the universe were constructed out of innumerable, infinitesimally small building blocks that they called atoms.</description>

It is for this reason that the physicist Carlo Rovelli has called Anaximander &amp;rsquo;the first scientist&#39;:&#xA;He paved the way for physics, geography, meteorology, and biology. Even more important than these contributions, he set in motion the process of rethinking our worldview—a search for knowledge based on the rejection of any obvious-seeming “certainty,” which is one of the main roots of scientific thinking.</description>

Details of her early life are hazy, and many of the accounts we have are unreliable; but it is likely that some time around 450 BCE she moved to Athens, fleeing political unrest. In Athens, she was classified as a resident alien, and lacked the rights of a citizen.</description>

      <description>Life Our knowledge of Diotima is so sparse that many people have concluded that she was not an historical figure, but instead a literary invention. Diotima appears as a character in Plato’s Symposium, where Socrates refers to her as “a woman of Mantinea—a woman who was wise in many things.” And our knowledge of her doesn’t extend far beyond this.&#xA;Diotima’s name means “honoured by Zeus.” Her name suggests that she was a priestess, and according to Plato’s Symposium, she was also a philosopher and one of Socrates’s teachers.</description>

      <description>Life The traditional dates for Confucius’s life are between 551 and 479 BCE. This makes him the contemporary of Greek philosophers like Heraclitus and Anaxagoras. He was born in the small state of Lu, now in present-day China. Confucius’s ancestors were high-ranking, but his father died when he was young, and Confucius was brought up in relative poverty.&#xA;In his early adulthood, Confucius served in various offices in the court of Lu.</description>

      <description>Life Thales of Miletus was born some time around 624 BCE. His birthplace, Miletus, was an important trading port in the Greek world, now on the coast of Turkey. And if Thales is credited with being the first philosopher in Ancient Greece, it is no surprise that he lived in a busy trading town. As strangers met in Miletus, they no doubt argued about their different world views as they looked for common ground to communicate and trade.</description>

      <description>Life Socrates (c.470 BCE — 399 BCE) was born in Athens, the son of a stonemason and a midwife. It is likely he worked for a time in the family business as a stonemason himself. He also undertook military service during the Peloponnesian War — perhaps one of the few times he travelled far from Athens.&#xA;His philosophical education was informal. He studied with the philosopher Anaxagoras. And according to his disciple Plato, he was also influenced by two women philosophers: Aspasia of Miletus, with whom he studied the arts of oratory; and the priestess Diotima of Mantinea.</description>
