In February 2023, we'll be running a session with the brilliant Premise Institute, exploring the question of [how we can find connection in a divided world](https://www.premiseinstitute.com/premisecourses).

We love Premise's work. They are based over in Portland, Oregon. We've never been over to Oregon, but we know its reputation as a mythical literary city, a place where everyone has their nose in a book. In this spirit, Premise run online sessions exploring books that raise _beautiful questions_, in a spirit of friendship and mutual enquiry.

In this session, which takes place on Saturday February 4, 2023, Will Buckingham will be encouraging participants to explore the question of what it means to connect with strangers, what the opportunities and risks of these connections are, and how connecting with strangers allows us to build new futures.
