> An elegant and moving exploration of what it means to connect with  strangers turns into an elegy for a much-missed way of life… while **Hello, Stranger** is a beautiful meditation on the pleasures and pains of a world to  which many of us yearn to return, it may also be an elegy for a world  that is lost to us for some time to come.
