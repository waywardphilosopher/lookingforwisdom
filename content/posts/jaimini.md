## Killed by an elephant

The  philosopher Jaimini is an obscure figure. We know almost nothing about  him, other than the story – which may or may not be true – that he was  killed by a rampaging elephant. But beyond this, the records are silent.

Although he is known as the founder of the *mīmāṃsā* philosophical school, we don't even know which century Jaimini lived in. The best guest for a date for the *Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra*, the foundational text of the *mīmāṃsā* philosophical tradition attributed to Jaimini, is sometime around 200 BCE, although  some scholars date it to a couple of centuries earlier. 

*Mīmāṃsā* philosophy is not particularly well-known outside specialist circles of scholars  of Indian philosophy and religion. Nevertheless, it was a long-lived and remarkably broad tradition, spanning around two thousand years. And it  is a tradition that still raises intriguing questions about ritual, and  about religious language.

## The sustaining power of ritual

The problem the *mīmāṃsā* philosophers faced was how to account for and justify the practices of ritual as set out in the ancient Vedic texts. The term *mīmāṃsā* literally means something like “the desire for knowledge”, “inquiry” or “reflection.” And what the philosophers of this tradition were  dedicated to reflecting upon or inquiring into were the ritual demands  set out in the ancient Vedic texts. 

The Vedas were traditionally divided into those parts that were concerned with knowledge (the **jñāna-kāṇḍa**) and those parts that were concerned with ritual action **(karma-kāṇḍa**). This division reflected a twofold division in the religious and  philosophical cultures of India. On the one hand, there was a long  tradition of philosophical speculation dating back to the *[Upaniṣads](/yajnavalkya/)*. On the other hand, there were the texts that set out, in painstaking  detail, the practical religious rituals that were considered to order  and sustain the universe.

The first of these may seem to naturally lend itself more easily to philosophical reflection. But the *mīmāṃsā* philosophers were committed to thinking through the second set of texts. They wanted to put philosophical flesh on the bones of these religious rituals,  making sense of them and justifying them.

In the Vedas, ritual is seen as having a sustaining and ordering power. For the ancient Indian *brahmins* or ritual specialists, the proper performance of ritual was considered to sustain the cosmic ordering of the universe or *dharma*. The idea that ritual has a sustaining role is one that is not unique to India, but is also found elsewhere, both in [Chinese Confucian philosophy](/ritual-and-creativity/) and in the [philosophical traditions of Mesoamerica](/maya-philosophy/). And perhaps this idea is not entirely unfamiliar today. Everyday  rituals underpin all social groups, from family units to workplaces to  entire nations. 

But for the ritualists of ancient India, ritual's sustaining power was more than just social. It didn't only uphold and  maintain the social fabric, but instead, it was considered to be a means of sustaining the universe as a whole. 

## The challenge of arbitrariness

And this is where *mīmāṃsā* scholars hit a problem. The problem was that of ritual's seemingly wilful  weirdness, its curious combination of apparent importance, and apparent  arbitrariness. Religious ritual, after all, is often marked by being  something *other than* everyday practice or behaviour. It is performatively strange, set apart from the everyday.

And this performative strangeness means that rituals are always open to the destabilising question of *why* things are done as they are. Why prostrate full-length before a shrine? Why  abstain from meat, or from food altogether, during this particular  time-period? Why wear such absurd hats? Why stand solemnly, hands  folded, for the national anthem? Why not crouch, or leap in the air  joyfully, or wave your arms around, or yodel in tune, or take off all  your clothes to demonstrate the naked force of your commitment to the  nation? Aren't all the odd forms of ritual behaviour in which human  beings indulge somehow arbitrary?

So when you start to ask the question of “why?” things are done as they  are, the seeming arbitrariness of ritual becomes a problem. This  question “why?” undermines ritual's seriousness, and risks leading us to the conclusion that ritual is just a lot of fuss about nothing. 

## Accounting for ritual

So, this is one way of understanding the task of Jaimini's *Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra:* to defend Vedic ritual practice against this charge of arbitrariness,  and along the way to demonstrate how this ritual practice can be taken  to be authoritative.

To do this, the *Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra* takes an interesting line of argument. It begins by asking what religious language is *for.* For Jaimini, what is central to the religious language (in the **karma-kāṇḍa** at least) is that it *tells us what to do*. Religious texts, for Jaimini, do not function by saying “this is the  case.” Nor do they aim to give us information about how things are,  bulletins from the divine. Instead, they simply tell us how to act. They tell us what we should and should not do and set out our duties.  Religious language, Jaimini argues, is about *injunctions* (*vidhi* in Sanskrit).

But what makes an injunction? For Jaimini, there's no point in an  injunction that tells us to do what we would do anyway. “Have a cup of  coffee, put your feet up, and watch TV” would not serve as a religious  injunction, because this is something that we might choose to do anyway. There's absolutely no force to an injunction such as this.

Nor do religious injunctions encode teachings that are useful to us for  external reasons, or from which we might derive some non-religious  benefit. For example, “eat three square meals a day (because it is good  for your health)” would not have the force of a religious injunction.

And, finally, Jaimini tells us, religious injunctions cannot enjoin us to do something we simply can't do. “Pray all day until you sprout wings, and then ascend to the heavens like a bird,” is not a good candidate for a  religious injunction, because you can pray all you like, but you will  remain wingless.

This means that for Jaimini, religious injunctions should be *possible*. They should be things that we can do (even if they are demanding). But  they should also be outside of those things that we might otherwise do  for non-religious reasons, even for good moral reasons. In other words,  they should be genuinely *novel.*[2] The oddness of ritual might  seem like a bug. But it turns out to be a feature, perhaps the defining  feature, of what marks something out as ritual.

## Texts without authors

However, this leads Jaimini to a curious place, because this implies that  religious injunctions do not have a moral or even a practical force. We  perform these things not because they are good or right, but because we  are enjoined to perform them. And here, it might look as if Jaimini is  doing the opposite of justifying ritual. Having given up on making an  appeal to usefulness, or to external moral criteria, as a way of  justifying any particular system of religious commands, isn't he instead justifying the *arbitrariness* of ritual? 

But Jaimini  recognises that this seeming arbitrariness is not the fatal flaw of  religious injunctions and rituals. Instead, it is the source of their  power. Jaimini follows this line of thought to push towards an  astonishingly bold conclusion. He claims that the Vedas are not  justified by anything outside themselves. They are absolutely  self-sufficient. The Vedas rest on nothing, because everything rests on  the Vedas. They are unauthored and eternal, without any need for  external justification. For the *mīmāṃsā* philosophers, one could say, “in the beginning was the text.” And it is *because* the Vedas do not rest on any external conditions, because they have no  justification beyond themselves, then they can be taken as having  supreme authority.

## The power of ritual

What is going on here? One way of answering this is by saying that for  Jaimini, it is precisely the seeming arbitrariness of religious language – the fact that it doesn't rest on external justifications – that makes it a possible ground of justification. It is as if he is saying, “Sure, religious language detaches itself from all external justifications:  but *that's the point – that's what makes it religious language*.”

This raises some intriguing questions about religious language and about the role of ritual in human life. Because even if we don't follow Jaimini  to his conclusions about the Vedic texts, perhaps it is possible to see  some deeper truths here. For example, the idea that religious  injunctions take their power from their strangeness and novelty, their  distance from practical concerns. Or the idea that the seeming  arbitrariness of religious and ritual injunctions is the key to their  strange, compelling power.
