+++

Love, we are told, lifts us up where we belong: “Where the eagles cry / On a mountain high… / Far from the world we know / Where the clear  winds blow.” 

When we are in love, the world takes on a different, more giddying perspective. But shifts in perspective are tricky things. When we are loved-up and out of our right minds, are we at last seeing  the world clearly? Or have we descended into a kind of madness? 

In this week's article, we're going to be exploring love, transcendence,  and madness in Plato's dialogues. We're going to see what the priestess  and philosopher [Diotima](/diotima) has to say about the transcendent path of love in Plato's *Symposium*. And we're going to see how in the *Phaedrus*, [Socrates](/socrates) argues that love sends us mad—while also making the case that sometimes a spot of madness is just what we need.

But we're going to start with the experience of finding ourselves suddenly  smitten, caught somewhere between madness and transcendence, just when  we least expect it. 

## Smitten kittens

You don't know how it happens. You can't predict when it will happen.  Nevertheless, it happens. One day, you run into somebody new, or you  find yourself unexpectedly seeing somebody you already know in a  different light. And you are utterly smitten. You are spellbound,  enchanted, barely able to breathe or to speak.

Sometimes  philosophers refer to this as “limerence”, a term first coined by the  psychiatrist Dorothy Tennov in the late 1970s. Tennov invented the word  to refer to the strange infatuation with another person that bursts upon you for no obvious reason. In an interview in the UK *Observer* in 1977, Tennov said,  

> I first used the term ‘amorance’ then changed it back to ‘limerence’… It  has no roots whatsoever. It looks nice. It works well in French. Take it from me it has no etymology whatsoever.[1]

It looks  good. It feels right. It works well in French. And it has no roots in  the real world. For all these reasons, “limerence” sounds like a  well-coined term for romantic infatuation.

In her 1979 book *Love and Limerence: The Experience of Being in Love*, Tennov writes that when you are in a state of limerence, you can think  of nothing but the object of your desires. You cannot sleep. You lose  your appetite. The object of your desires takes on a transcendent glow.  And what you long for most is that your obsession should be  reciprocated. 

However, there is something problematic with  limerence. The single-minded focus of limerent obsession is potentially  destructive: both for the one who is so obsessed, and for the object of  their obsession. What if the other person has no interest in  reciprocation? What if this limerent experience is used to justify (as  it often is) all manner of crazy, creepy, stalky, destructive  behaviours? Maybe limerence should be seen as a condition, a sickness  (and, indeed, there is even a Reddit community dedicated to supporting  those “who self-identify as being in the state of limerence and are  looking for support and strategies to deal with their condition.”)

## Love's upward trajectory?

But, if Plato is to be believed, limerence may also be a doorway to a different way of seeing the world. In the *Symposium*, Socrates relates the story of how Diotima taught him that infatuation can be the first step on a path to transcendence.

Diotima's theory of love, as it appears in the *Symposium*, functions like a staircase or a ladder (it is often referred to as the  “ladder of love”). Love is a process of ascent, with each stage  providing a broader, more expansive view of love—and of reality  itself—than the one before.

Diotima argues that love begins in an  infatuation with the body of a single individual. This infatuation  “begets beautiful ideas”—which seems like a nice description of the way  our minds can be filled with dreamy notions about the object of our  desires.

But the path of love only begins here: this is not where  it ends. The next stage comes about when the lover realises the same  beauty that inspires their infatuation lies not just in their beloved,  but in others as well. After all, Diotima cautions, we would “be very  foolish not to think that the beauty of all bodies is one and the same.” Here, the lover loosens their obsessive focus on one particular  individual, to see that all others are potential objects of love (or of  limerence). And when they see this, it becomes apparent that the desire  they have for any single individual is a limited, cramped thing. This  more general understanding of desire removes the lover from their  fixation on a single object. And it reminds them that even though every  other individual is unique and singular, this uniqueness and singularity are not in short supply. Singularity is everywhere. Everyone is unique, even if they are not uniquely so.

The next stage is when the  lover recognises that beauty lies not just in bodies but in souls too.  What we are attracted to, in the end, is not just a set of physical  attributes, but a *person*.

And then, taking a further step up the staircase or the ladder, we go from recognising the beauty of *persons* to perceiving the beauty of the things these persons together fashion:  human activities, institutions and cultures. Because if we are in touch  with beauty, and if we value beauty, then together we can build  beautiful things.

After this, Diotima says, the lover comes to recognise the beauty of the  learning and knowledge that these cultures and institutions sustain. By  now, Diotima says, “the lover is turned to the great sea of beauty, and, gazing upon this, they give birth to many gloriously beautiful ideas  and theories, in unstinting love of wisdom.”

But there's one final stage to this path. The culmination of the path of love is not just in  the love of wisdom, or philosophy. Instead, it is in the love of beauty  and of love itself. This is how Socrates summarises the argument. 

> This is what it is to go aright, or be led by another, into the mystery of  Love: one goes always upwards for the sake of this Beauty, starting out  from beautiful things and using them like rising stairs: from one body  to two and from two to all beautiful bodies, then from beautiful bodies  to beautiful customs, and from customs to learning beautiful things, and from these lessons he arrives in the end at this lesson, which is  learning of this very Beauty, so that in the end he comes to know just  what it is to be beautiful...

So what starts with our  infatuation with one individual other leads us step-wise, Diotima  argues, towards true knowledge and towards the love of love. This makes  the path of love a complete religious and philosophical path, starting  in limerence, and ending in transcendent experience . 

## Madly in love?

But if love takes us above or beyond our right minds, then there's another  question we need to ask: is this really such a good thing? After all,  Tennov writes that limerence is “clearly a madness.” And Plato and  Socrates knew this too. The long sufferings of the Trojan war began with the limerent desires of Paris and Helen. It is no accident that at the  opening of Plato's *Phaedrus*, his dialogue on love and madness, Socrates makes a passing reference to Homer's story.

But if love is a kind of madness, in the *Phaedrus* Socrates wants to make the case that sometimes “the madness of love” is  something we should actively seek. Ultimately, Socrates argues, madness  can do more for us than “right-minded reason.” And the “divine madness”  that is sent by the gods can be humanly and philosophically fruitful.  God-sent madness, Socrates says, is better than human self-control.

Socrates gives four reasons that the madness of love can be beneficial. The  first is that there is a connection between madness and prophecy.  Socrates uses an etymological argument to talk about the closeness of  the word *manic* or “mad” and the word *mantic*, or  “prophetic” (as in “pyromancy”, meaning divination by fire, or  “oneiromancy”, meaning divination by dreams). In the madness of love, we can have more profound insights into the world, just as the oracles of  the ancient world, taken by divine madness, spoke prophecies and  insights. 

The second fruit of love's madness, Socrates says, is  that it is purificatory. In particular, it has the power to purge us of  deep, ancestral guilt. In the wild, purificatory frenzy of madness, we  are liberated from the rigorous logic of retribution and responsibility. And we become free.

The third fruit of madness is that it gives  rise to creativity. We all know, after all, that the love-sick can turn  to poetry (often, it has to be said, *bad* poetry) to try to make sense of their sickness. So the madness of love can provoke us to  create new things, in a “frenzy of songs and poetry that glorifies the  achievements of the past and teaches them to future generations.” 

And the final fruit of madness, Socrates says, is the madness of  transcendence. The lover is driven to a transcendent view that put them  beyond the world, removed from the everyday logic of the world, soaring  towards the realms of pure beauty:  

> Now this takes me to the whole point of my discussion of the fourth kind of madness—that  which someone shows when he sees the beauty we have down here and is  reminded of true beauty; then he takes wing and flutters in his  eagerness to rise up, but is unable to do so; and he gazes aloft, like a bird, paying no attention to what is down below...

But  in his description of this final kind of madness, Socrates sounds a note of caution. Because for Socrates, love doesn't lift us up where we  belong. Or at least, *not quite*. It provokes the desire for true beauty—the end of Diotima's quest. It sets our eyes on the heavens. It  removes us from our concerns with what is “down below.” But as we take  wing, our hearts all aflutter in our eagerness to rise beyond the  everyday world, we are unable to fully attain the beauty for which we  yearn.

And this is perhaps why, when a friend falls hard in love,  you find them sitting by the window, staring dreamily out at the sky—as  if they've forgotten the world of which they are still, nevertheless, a  part.

## Questions

Here are some questions to get you thinking about this week's lesson. So dive into the comments on the Agora, and let's chat.

1. Have you ever experienced limerence? What is this experience like? And what does it tell us about human love and desire? 
2. How plausible is Diotima's account of love's upward ascent?
3. The story of Diotima's ladder puts a strong focus on the idea of beauty as  something that is powerfully transformative. Do you think that  recognising beauty—in others, even in cultures and in institutions—can  be transformative in this way?
4. Socrates gives four different  arguments in favour of madness. In what ways, if any, can madness (or an absence of reason) be beneficial?
5. In Socrates's account of the  madness of love, he doesn't dwell on the potentially destructive effects of this madness (although he does reference the Trojan war in passing). Do you think the destructive effects of “being out of your right mind”  with love outweigh the benefits? And if so, what is the best remedy for  this madness?

### Online resources

There's a fascinating article on Quartz asking what if the purpose of falling in love (and of limerence) is not to get us *into* relationships, but instead to get us *out of* them. [Read the link here](https://qz.com/176136/what-if-the-purpose-of-love-is-to-get-us-out-of-relationships-not-into-them/).

For Diotima, love occupies a place *between* the everyday and the divine. The [philosopher file on Diotima](/diotima) is worth reading in connection with the final ideas on transcendence that cannot be entirely fulfilled.
