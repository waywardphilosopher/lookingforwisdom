## Taking your father to court

The philosopher [Socrates](/socrates) is outside the court in Athens. He has been accused of impiety and  corrupting the minds of the youth of the city—a charge for which he will soon be executed. As he is idling in the street outside the courthouse, he comes across an earnest young man called Euthyphro. The young man is bringing a charge of murder against his father, something that is all  but unthinkable in Athenian society.

The substance of the charge  is this. A servant who worked for Euthyphro's father got drunk, and in a fit of anger killed one of the household slaves. Euthyphro's dad took  the servant, bound him hand and foot and threw him in a ditch while he  decided what to do with him next. Unfortunately, before he could come to a decision, the servant died of hunger.

Socrates is shocked that Euthyphro is taking his father to court. But Euthyphro defends himself as follows:

> It is ridiculous, Socrates, for you to think that it makes any difference  whether the victim is a stranger or a relative. One should only watch  whether the killer acted justly or not; if he acted justly, let him go,  but if not, one should prosecute... [1]

Euthyphro argues that taking his father to court is the good and pious thing to do, even though under Athenian law only the relatives of the dead can press  murder charges. Socrates, who is himself being accused of impiety,  seizes on Euthyphro's argument about the universality of justice and  gets into a long wrangle with the young man about the nature of piety  and goodness and justice, tying Euthyphro up in knots.

Plato's  dialogue is fascinating for a multitude of reasons. But the central  tension with which it begins is one that is with us to this day: what  happens when we encounter a conflict between our personal affiliations  and loves, and the impersonal demands of justice?

Last week, we  saw how we are evolved to live in small face-to-face societies. And for  human beings living in groups like this, most interpersonal  relationships can be negotiated on an *ad hoc* basis. But when  scale things up, then things get more complicated. Then a tension opens  up between the affiliations  we have with those closest to us, and the  demands of living in society with people most of whom are strangers.

## Gong and the missing sheep

There's an even starker version of the problem faced by Euthyphro and Socrates in the *Analects* of [Confucius](/confucius).

> The Duke of She said to Confucius, “Among my people there is one we call  ‘Upright Gong.’ When his father stole a sheep, he reported him to the  authorities.”
>
> Confucius replied, “Among my people, those who we  consider ‘upright’ are different from this: fathers cover up for their  sons, and sons cover up for their fathers. ‘Uprightness’ is to be found  in this.”[2]

For Confucius, the demand that fathers should "cover up" for their sons, and vice versa (the Chinese word *yin* literally means "to hide" or "to conceal") is a crucial component of the virtue usually known as filial piety (*xiao* in Chinese). It's worth taking a moment to see what Confucius is and isn't saying here. He is not saying that the father should not be charged  with the crime of stealing a sheep. He is saying that it shouldn't be  his son who reports him to the authorities.

One way of understanding this is in terms of a tension between two kinds of "uprightness" (or, in Chinese, *zhi*). On the one hand, there is an uprightness to taking the law seriously.  But on the other hand, there is an uprightness to observing the proper  relationships with those who are close to you. Of course, we might say,  we should obey the law. That is the upright thing to do. And of course,  we should also do our best to protect the interests of those to whom we  are closest. That too is the upright thing to do. But what happens when  these two forms of uprightness come into conflict?

But is Confucius *really* saying we should let those who are close to us get away with anything,  simply because they are close to us? This is a reading of the passage  that sits awkwardly with Confucius's other teachings. However, there is  another reading. In this reading, Confucius recognises that when it  comes to strangers or those with whom we don't have personal bonds, it  may be appropriate to resort to the law when we encounter wrongdoing.  But when it comes to our intimates and those we are personally connected with, when we encounter wrongdoing, our first port of call shouldn't be impersonal law. Instead, we should resort to other methods to help  bring our wayward relatives in line.

Sometimes people think about  Confucian filial piety as being exclusively about obedience. But  the  scholar Yong Huang points out that a crucial component of filial piety  is *remonstration*. An example is in the following passage from the *Family Sayings of Confucius* or *Kongzi Jiayu.*

> In ancient times, when a good king of a big state has seven ministers who  dare to remonstrate, the king will not make mistakes; if a middle sized  state has five remonstrating ministers, the state will have no danger;  if a small state has three remonstrating ministers, the official  salaries and positions can last. If a father has a remonstrating child,  he will not fall into doing things without propriety; and if a scholar  has a remonstrating friend, he will not do immoral things. So how can a  son who merely obeys the parents be regarded as being filial, and a  minister who merely obeys the ruler be regarded as being loyal? To be  filial and loyal is to examine what to follow. [3]

When  it comes to a serious transgression—murder, for example—we may disagree  that remonstration is the best first option. But for more minor  transgressions, this goes with our instincts. If your child (or parent)  stole a bar of chocolate from the small shop around the corner, it would be weird to immediately resort to impersonal justice as a way to right  this wrong, and to drive them to the nearest police station. Instead,  our instincts are probably that the right thing to do is to remonstrate  with them, point out that stealing chocolate is probably not the best  thing to do, and persuade them to take the chocolate back to the shop.

## The challenge of universal love

For Confucius, it is entirely right that we respond differently to those  who are closest to us. For each of us, our intimates form a circle of  care and specific moral concern. And this is consistent with the idea of Dunbar's number that we explored in last week's article: the idea that  human beings are adapted to keep track of a [small handful of close intimates](/love02-we-all-stand-together/).

As a way of ordering society, this makes sense. We can't care for  everyone's grandmother. But we might hope to live in a society where  everybody cares for their own grandmother. You could see this Confucian  view of society as an affiliation of interlocking units, each of these  units bound by a sense of the proper relationships of care and moral  concern. If this system worked as it should, then the need for laws and  punishments, Confucius believed, would be minimal or even non-existent.  If rulers set the right moral tone for their subjects, and their  ministers held them morally to account, if parents set the right moral  tone for their children, and their children held them to account, the  society would function well.

But not everyone in ancient China  agreed. The philosopher Mozi, who flourished around 430 BCE, was  concerned that the partiality at the heart of Confucian ethics could too easily lead to self-interest and disorder. Instead, he argued in favour of what he called *jian ai*, or “universal love.” For Mozi and  his followers (known as Mohists), universal love requires that we should respond equally and impartially to all other, regardless of the  closeness of our connection. Confucian moral concern, the Mohists  claimed, is blinkered and narrow.

Mozi's starting point for his  argument is that human societies fall into disorder because of a lack of love. The  reason that you go out in the first place to steal that  chocolate bar, or to steal that sheep, is a lack of love. You have not  fully taken on board the interests of the sheep-owner, or the  shop-owner. Acts like this are a failure of imagination, but they are  also a failure of love. If you have sufficient love for others, this  means you are unwilling to disadvantage them for your own advantage.

This is how Mozi makes his argument:

> A sage, in taking the ordering of the world to be his business, must  examine what disorder arises from. In his attempts, what does he  discover disorder to arise from? It arises from lack of mutual love...  Even if we come to those who are thieves and robbers in the world the  same applies insofar as they love their own household but do not love  the households of others. Therefore, they plunder other households in  order to benefit their own households. A robber loves himself but not  others. Therefore he robs others in order to benefit himself. How is  this? In all cases it arises through want of mutual love. [4]

What Mozi calls love is the ability to take others' interests into account,  and to see these interests as having equal weight with our own interests and the interests of those close to us. Mozi's *jian ai* is, in  many ways, about justice, about how to manage the competing interests of different members of society. But the fact that Mozi talks about *love* suggests that this is more than just an intellectual principle of  balancing out our interests against the interests of others. Instead, it is the idea that it is possible for us to have a feelingful and  meaningful connection with the interests of those outside our narrow  circle.

## What society depends on 

The problem with Mozi's demand for universal love is, as Mozi himself  admits, that it is very difficult. And one thing that makes it  difficult, as we saw in the previous piece, is that we are not really  equipped to cope with more than a small circle of one hundred and fifty  others.

And this fact reminds us that in one sense, the rift  between Mohism and Cofucianism is not as large as it might at first  seem. The Mohists and the Confucians both know that we are partial, and  that our concerns are partial. And they are both aware that broader  systems of moral norms are important for a well-functioning society.  What they differ on, above all else, is whether we should struggle to  overcome our partiality, and what role law should play in our societies.

For the Mohists, if we want our societies to function well, it is important to manage our tendencies to partiality, and to put in place policies  that encourage all those who live in that society to extend out the  circle of their caring. And here we come to a surprising aspect of the  disagreement between the Confucians and the Mohists. For Confucius, if  our tendency for partial love is well-regulated by virtue and ritual,  there is little need for legal systems of reward and punishment: our  natural moral concern for those we love is all that we need for a  well-functioning society. In the *Analects*, Confucius claims that:

> If you try to guide the common people with coercive regulations and keep  them in line with punishments, the common people will become evasive and will have no sense of shame. If, however, you guide them with virtue,  and keep them in line by means of ritual, the people will have a sense  of shame and will rectify themselves. [5]

There is an  argument here that the ideal for Confucius is a kind of anarchism, but  an anarchism of a weird kind. In this Confucian anarchist model, the  system recognises multiple hierarchies. But the connections we have with each other are regulated by custom, ritual and virtue, rather than by  law.

But for the Mohists, this idea is fanciful. No society has  ever functioned like this. So if we want to encourage universal love, we need strict laws in place to police it:

> Now things like  universal mutual love and the exchange of mutual benefit are both  beneficial and easy to practise in innumerable ways. I think it is only a matter of not having a ruler who delights in them, and that is all. If  there was a ruler who delighted in these things, and encouraged people  with rewards and praise, and intimidated them with penalties and  punishments, I think the people would take to universal mutual love and  interchange of mutual benefit just like fire goes up and water goes down and cannot be stopped in the world. [6]

Whether we think Mozi has it right, or whether we go with Confucius, between them, these two thinkers set out a tension that to this day is still hard to  resolve. On the one hand, we are partial beings, evolved to live in  small social groups where we love and care deeply for our intimates. But on the other hand, we are members of larger-scale societies where the  needs of others conflict with our own partial caring.

How do we  take into account the needs of others, many of whom we might never meet? Whom should we love? Why and how should we care? And what role should  law have in making sure that we care?

## Questions

1. If somebody close to you, or somebody you loved, had committed a serious  crime, what would you do? Would you report them, or would you try to  remonstrate with them? And what do you think the right thing to do would be?
2. Now think about the same question, but with a minor transgression (like stealing a chocolate bar). How do your answers change?
3. And another question following on from the last two: where is the boundary, if any, between transgressions where you would favour interpersonal  affiliation and love over broader concerns with justice?
4. What is a more plausible basis for a well-ordered society: the model given by  Confucius of graded concern, or the model given by Mozi of universal  love? Why do you think this?
5. Are the two models necessarily opposed to each other? Or can you find a way to harmonise them?
