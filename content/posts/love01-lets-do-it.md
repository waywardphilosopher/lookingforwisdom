## Welcome to our Season Two Looking for Wisdom Course

Birds do it. Bees do it. And according to Cole Porter, even educated fleas do it (although I'm not quite so sure). But what is this thing called  love? What does it mean to fall in love? And why does love loom so large in our individual and collective lives?

Welcome to season two in  our Looking for Wisdom course series, where we're going to be exploring  the philosophy of love. Over the coming seven weeks, we're going to be  trying to make some sense of what is one of our deepest—and often most  confusing—human preoccupations. 

## Love songs

Human beings have always been obsessed with love. One indication of the depth of this obsession is in the number of songs that testify to the  varieties of human love. Love songs seem almost universal. Here's an  example from ancient Sumer, around 4000 years ago, written by a woman to her lover:

> Man, I will ply you with charm.
> My treasure, I will bring you honey,
> in the bedroom oozing honey.
> Let us enjoy your charm.
> Darling, I will ply you with charm.
> My treasure, I will bring you honey.[1]

Over in China, the *Shi Jing* or *Book of Songs* contains many songs about love, lust, and everything in between. One example is  this song about a lover who has a date with a certain Zhongzi, who seems determined to lustily vault over the fence into the lover's garden,  even at the risk of causing trouble.

> Please, Zhongzi,
> Don’t climb into our garden,
> Don’t break the spindle trees we have planted.
> Not that I am concerned with them,
> I am afraid of what people say.
> I love you, Zhongzi,
> But I am afraid
> Of what people will say. *[2]*

And one of my favourites is this entertaining gem from India, in the anthology of love songs called the *Gāhā Sattasaī*. In this song, a woman is dousing the flames as her house burns; but the kindling of the flames of love gives her hope not all is lost:

> Even though everything I had went up in flames I am overjoyed,
> For during the fire
> It was he who took the bucket of water
> From my hand into his. [3]

And a couple of thousand years later, we're still at it. Things fall apart, Miley Cyrus reminds us. And nothing breaks like a heart. Throughout  human history, the sheer amount of energy that has been put into falling in love, falling out of love, renouncing love, embracing love, arguing  about love, worrying about love, thinking about love, writing about love and singing about love is staggering. 

There's something going on here, something that is ripe for philosophical discussion. But what?

## Biological machines and social roles

One thing that makes love hard to pin down is that although love seems to  be a human universal, it looks very different in different contexts. 

In her book *What Love is, and What it Could Be*, philosopher Carrie Jenkins writes that love is “ancient biological  machinery embodying a modern social role” [4]. When we fall in love,  there is real biological stuff going on. And if we (and the birds and  the bees and the educated fleas) all do it, the reasons for this are  rooted in our biology and our evolutionary history. We get turned on. We lust. We desire. We navigate complex webs of trust and affection.  Irreducibly social animals, we snuggle and cuddle and seek the company  of others whom we like. This is what we were made for.

Because of  this shared biological heritage, we feel we can understand when a singer in ancient Sumer sings about being in the bedroom oozing honey. We get  what is going on when the lusty Zhongzi tries to vault over the fence.  We smile, as the ancient Indian poet may have smiled, at the image of  the woman dousing the flames as her house burns, and finding her heart  leap in her chest as she is passed a bucket of water by the object of  her affections.

But love in is not *straightforwardly* biological. Although we *get* the Indian love song, we perhaps don't get it in quite the same way an  Indian reader might. The meanings we give fire are not quite the same  that the ancient Indian poet gave them. And the meanings we give love  are not the same either. So alongside all our biological commonalities,  if we want to make sense of human ideas of love, we need to take account of human malleability. The forms love takes, the meanings we give it,  the ways in which we understand it, are all fashioned by the cultures of which we are a part. Love is culture *and* biology.

Of  course, this combination of ancient biological machinery and modern  social roles is not unique to love. It is an instance of a broader  anthropological truth about the way biology and culture intersect. Many  aspects of human life—justice, friendship, family—can only be understood if we take account of both social and cultural roles and our underlying biological machinery. And this is one reason why, in our search for  philosophical understanding, it pays to take a broader perspective,  rather than relying on the insights of one culture or one tradition.

This is certainly the case when it comes to love. Philosophical discussions  of love are often rooted in Greek and European traditions. But they tend to pay less attention to traditions from elsewhere. So in this course, I want to try something different. In our quest for understanding what  love is, we'll be going further afield. We'll be exploring notions of  love in Greece and India, in the philosophical cultures of sub-Saharan  Africa, and in the rainforest cultures of Amazonia. Because only when we see how the same biological themes are transformed by endlessly  inventive cultural variations, can we start to understand the complex  territories of human love.

## Messy love, and philosophical housekeeping

There's something messy about love. And the messiness is part of the reason for our fascination. Love is hard to pin down, hard to get a handle on.  Human love seems such a slippery kind of thing that it gives rise to  endless confusion and uncertainty. 

For some philosophers—those  for whom the primary task of philosophy is clearing up conceptual  confusion—the temptation when confronted by this kind of mess is to come bustling in with brushes and brooms to start tidying things up. And  this might seem at first glance to be a good thing. Who likes undue  confusion? But if you want to understand the mess of human life, you  admit the philosophers into your house at your peril. Once they have  tidied things away, moved around the furniture, and conjured ingeniously rational systems for filing all those bits and pieces that you have  lying around, things may certainly *seem* tidier. Everything may  look sparkling and new, the lines of argument clear. But once the  philosophers have done their work, it can sometimes also be hard not to  feel slightly less at home. Philosophical accounts of human existence  can be like those idealized show-homes you sometimes see: well-tended,  meticulously thought-out, but ultimately not very liveable. And when it  comes to philosophical accounts of love, if there is too much clearing  away of the everyday human mess, along the way it is hard not to feel  that something has been lost. 

## Living with (a modicum of) mess

This is not to say that we should give up on the task of clearing up  conceptual confusion. When engaging in philosophical housekeeping, it  can be good to put things in order. We can't live in the middle of  absolute conceptual chaos. But philosophy isn't just about clearing up  confusion. It is also be about something close to its opposite. It is  about awakening us to new kinds of perplexity, precisely when we thought everything was tidily nailed-down.

Sometimes, philosophy can help us *clear up* the questions that bother us. But at other times, it can help us *deepen* these questions, disrupting our tidy everyday assumptions, and sowing  perplexity and confusion where once we imagined everything was in order. 

If we want to live and love and thrive, both these approaches  are needed. We cannot live well when everything is simply chaos and  confusion. But we cannot live well if we shoehorn the disorderliness of  human life into too narrow a conceptual framework. Sometimes, when  things are looking just *too* tidy, it's necessary to mess them up a bit. Or at least to acknowledge that mess is inevitable. 

So by the end of this course, you shouldn't expect to have the answers to  the Great Questions about love. After seven weeks of exploring  philosophical ideas of love, we're not going to be able to rest easy,  with “love” filed away tidily on the shelf.

By the end of this  course, you may have some partial answers to at least some of the  questions you have about love. But you may equally find that these  questions have just become deeper, more perplexing and more puzzling.  Either way, I hope that a bit more philosophical nuance, and a broader  idea of what is at stake, will help you better navigate the challenges  and the puzzles of human life and love.

## What's in this course?

Over the coming seven weeks, we'll be roaming from Ancient Greece, China,  and India to the rich philosophical traditions of sub-Saharan Africa and the rainforests of Amazonia, taking a global perspective on how and why we love.

- **Week 1: “Let's Do It.” The philosophy of love** 
  In week one, we look at love songs, the universality of human love, the  intersection of biology and culture and some questions about  philosophical housekeeping.
- **Week 2: “We All Stand Together.” Love, connection and community**
  In week two, we'll be looking at philosophical ideas about love,  connection, and community. Love is inherently social. So what does it  mean to be a social being who loves and hates, snuggles and struggles.
- **Week 3: “Something so Right.” Love and justice**
  You come home one day to find your beloved planning a raid on the local  bank. Do you choose justice and hand them over to the care of the  police? Or do you choose love, and help them achieve their goals?
- **Week 4: “You Sexy Thing.” Getting philosophical about sex**
  When Cole Porter sings about what birds, bees and educated fleas get up to,  we all know he's not just talking about love: he's talking about sex. In week three, we'll be getting philosophical about sex. 
- **Week 5: “Love Lifts Us Up Where We Belong.” Love, transcendence and madness**
  Love is sometimes said to be something that has the power to transports us  to a different way of being. But does love really lift us up where we  belong? Does it make us whole? Or is it even a kind of madness?
- **Week 6: “Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?” Love, uncertainty and the future**
  Love often seems be about our ideas of the future, and how we make sense of  living in a world where the future is uncertain. So this week, we'll  explore how love, trust, and our hopes and fears for the future are  tangled up together.
- **Week 7: “Wise men say only fools rush in.” Love and wisdom**
  In the final week, we'll talk about philosophy, or the “love of wisdom”.  Is wisdom really that loveable? And is there a deeper philosophical  relationship between wisdom and love?

## Questions

Here are some questions to get you thinking about these ideas. If you are a  member, dive into the comments on the Agora, and let's chat.

1. If you were put on the spot and asked for a provisional definition of love, how would you define it?
2. If love involves both biological machinery and culture, how do we  distinguish between what is cultural and what is biological? How is it  possible to draw a clear line? 
3. Is love really so different in  different cultural contexts? Can you think of any examples (either from  history, or from your own experience)?
4. In this piece, I suggest  that love is inherently messy and confusing. But is it? Or, if we are  philosophical enough, is there a chance that we can sort out the mess  and the confusion?
