## The puzzle of gift-giving

It's the time of year when, for those of us who live in countries and  communities where Christmas is celebrated, we face the prospect of an  explosion of gift exchange. This gift-giving raises all kinds of  practical issues (as we asked [in the last philosopher file](/philosophy-of-giving/), what *do* you get a man like Uncle Pedro?). But it is also philosophically puzzling.  Why do we do it? What's going on in this frenzy of giving and receiving  gifts?

Last time, we looked at what could be called the paradox of gift-giving. On the one hand, gift-giving has the appearance of free  exchange; but on the other hand, it is bound up with all kinds of  obligations. Our philosophical excursion into the world of gift-giving  in the previous Philosopher File left us in an uncomfortable place.  Because according to the philosopher Jacques Derrida, for there to be a  gift at all, it would be necessary this escape the economy of gift and  counter-gift, this whole notion of exchange. A true gift is a gift where you *get nothing back* because when you get something back, you  are no longer talking about a gift, you are talking about exchanging one thing for another. But where in the world can you find a gift such as  this, a gift free of mutual obligation, free of any counter-gift, free  of calculations about exchange?

The argument seems a compelling  one. It is also unsettling because if you follow it through, it looks as if everything is on the brink of collapsing (or as if it has already  collapsed) into the logic of economic reason. And it forces us to ask if there is any space for something apart from self-interest.

So in  this week's philosopher file, we are going to get more practical about  gifts, so we can find a way out of this impasse. Because if you look  more closely, it is not clear that Derrida's account really matches how  gifts work; and his notion of the gift doesn't really map on to how we *experience* gift-giving. For Derrida, the only true gift would be the gift that  left no trace, that effaced or erased itself, so undercutting the logic  of exchange. But arguably, such a gift is no gift at all.

Why is  this the case? Think of it like this. If you give me a gift, I not only  want to get something out of it myself (it's nice to be given gifts),  but I want *you* to get something out of it (it's nice to give). As the recipient of a gift, I *want* there to be some counter-gift, even if it is only knowing that you have a  warm glow when you give something to me. I want this not because I am  relentlessly thinking about economic circles and balancing the books  (even if I may have an eye on this): I want it because it seems, in the  moment of gift-giving, that we are both getting more than we started  with. In the giving (or exchange) of gifts, our mutual aim is to both  feel like we are coming out of the transaction with a sense that life  has been somehow augmented by this exchange. As a recipient, this means I *want* you to get something out of it, even if it is only the pleasure of giving. This mutuality is central to gift-giving.

## Breaking the symmetry of gift and counter-gift

The great anthropologist and theorist Marcel Mauss, in his **Essai sur le don**, or “Essay on the Gift”, talked about how our concerns with generosity  often mask a strict accounting system of gift and counter-gift. Of  course, it's undeniably true that in gift-giving we do keep an eye on  these things. But we do so not because our ultimate aim in gift-giving  is to ensure strict symmetry. Instead, we do it because a  rough-and-ready appropriateness of gift and counter-gift keeps the  machinery of gift-giving running. So we keep our eye on these things  much in the same way we might keep our eye on the functioning of a car  engine. We don't want the engine to break down. But we are not running  it for its own sake. We are running it to *take us somewhere*. A  well-functioning engine is not our aim. It is not our destination. But  keeping an eye on how the machinery works helps us get to this aim or  destination, whatever it may be.

It is the same with the engine of gift-giving. You want it to take you somewhere, so it makes sense to  keep your eye on how the machine is running. And one part of this is  keeping your eye on the appropriateness of gift and counter-gift. But,  despite everything Mauss says, here you don't want exact symmetry: this  is the worst thing possible if what you care about is keeping the  machine running.

Both experience and anthropological data back up  the importance of asymmetry in gift exchange. The anthropologist Roy  Wagner's fieldwork among Daribi-speaking peoples in Papua New Guinea  gives us a good example of this. Among these communities, Wagner writes, the last thing you want to do in gift-giving is to have symmetry.  Symmetry, or a concern with symmetrical exactness, kills off the  dynamism and the pleasure that underpins gift exchange in the first  place [1]. Asymmetry, as long it isn't too severe, is the thing that  keeps gift exchange ticking over, that lends the system its life and its energy. 

So what do we look for in gift exchange, if not for  symmetry? Here we can find one answer in the indigenous philosophies of  Indonesia. In her brilliant ethnography of the Tanimbar Islands in  Southeast Maluku, the anthropologist Susan McKinnon writes about the  complex cycles of gift exchange that once crisscrossed the islands. At  first glance, these exchanges may seem like the kind of exchanges that  Mauss talked about, bound by rigorous mutual obligations. And to some  extent, they were, at least to the extent that accepting some mutual  obligation is necessary to keep the machine (or the game) running. But  the game of gift-giving in Tanimbar was played not for the sake of  symmetry or of profit, but for the sake of something beyond the game  itself: the new possibilities, relationships, and pleasures the game  opens up. As McKinnon's  Tanimbarese hosts told her, the purpose of  gift-giving was not to “look for profit,” but instead to “look for  relation.” [2]

In this looking for relation, what is optimal is not cold, hard accounting. It is a sense that we are *both* winners in an exchange: a sense that there is a surplus benefit, beyond our economic reasoning, that makes things better for both parties.

McKinnon's Tanimbarese friends told her that the hallmark of a good gift in Tanimbar is that it should be *manminak*, a word in the Fordatan language that means “tasty,” “sweet” or “good.” A non-tasty, non-sweet, non-good gift, or one that we do not experience  as tasty, sweet and good, is something that we wouldn't experience as a  gift.

And this also means that any gift that effaces itself (as  Derrida's impossible/possible gift does), that leaves no trace, that  won't get its hands dirty with economic cycles, is no gift at all. As we have already seen, if you give me a gift, I *want* you to get  something back, even if it is only the pleasure of giving. But this  doesn't leave us fully within the sphere of economic reason. Because as  we make exchanges and counter-exchanges, looking for relation if our  gifts are well-made, all parties benefit from the tastiness, the  sweetness, the goodness of this giving.

Gift-giving, at best, is  not about economic circles. It is about spirals where, with every single cycle, things get better for us all.

## Gifts as creative works

Derrida's work may throw into perspective some of our *anxieties* around gift-giving. And this is no doubt useful. But the metaphor of closed  circles of exchange simply doesn't do a very good job of describing what it is like to engage in gift exchange. And the spiral-like view of  gift-giving sketched out above seems to me to be closer to the actual *experience* we have of gifts if they are well-given and well-received. Beyond  symmetry, looking for relation rather than profit, we exchange gifts to  make life tastier, sweeter, better. 

In the picture that is  beginning to emerge here, rather than seeing a gulf between pure  economic reason on the one hand, and the pure gift that leaves no trace  on the other, gift-giving seems something more messy and tangled. It is  compromised but not fatally so. It is bound up with economic anxiety,  but also with mutually-enhancing pleasure. And it is also something  inherently creative. As I put it in my book  [*Hello, Stranger: How We Find Connection in a Disconnected World*](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/hello-stranger-how-we-find-connection-in-a-disconnected-world/9781783785643), the writer Lewis Hyde has argued that creative works are gifts. But the reverse is also true gifts are creative works. They create trust  between strangers. They create new possibilities and new futures.

## Weighing up gift-giving

Once we put to one side for a moment our anxieties about the inescapability  of economic reason, this opens the way to asking about what makes a good gift. And here, the philosophical traditions of India can help.

For many Indian philosophical traditions, the question of *dāna*, or giving, is of central importance. But these traditions sidestep the  anxiety found in Derrida's work. There's a robust acceptance of the idea that a gift *is* a gift, leaving us with the question of how we can make sure that gifts are well-made.

According to the Jain text, the *Tattvārtha Sūtra*, dating to between the 2nd and 5th century CE, the worth of a gift is to be judged by the “excellence in the donor, the recipient, the  procedure, and the substance.” This means there are four considerations  when weighing up the worth of a gift:

1. Who is giving
2. To whom they are giving
3. How they are giving
4. What is being given

There are similar lists in other traditions as well. The Buddhists, for  example, often list three criteria for judging the worth of the gift:  the state of mind of the donor, the gift given, and the recipient. And  these three criteria map, more or less, onto the first, second, and  fourth from the Jain list. But the Jain list is nice because the  question of *how* a gift is given encompasses not only the state  of mind of the donor but also ticklish questions of timeliness, social  context, ritual and appropriateness, all of which seem to be centrally  important to most human gift-giving.

As Mariah Heim points out in  her book about theories of gift-giving in South Asia, in all of these  South Asian traditions, the concern with *dāna* or giving “does  not theorize the gift as a site for self-interested individuals to make  (and mask) exchanges.” [3] But neither does it see one-way,  unreciprocated gifts as entirely selfless and pure. Instead, it sees the act of giving as something that “makes possible valued human  relationships based on esteem and admiration.” 

And as a way of  thinking through good gifts and bad gifts, if we can shake off our  Derridean anxieties for a moment, the Jain approach gives us a good  starting point. These are all questions worth asking: *Who am I to give this gift? To whom do I want to give it? How should I best give it? And what should I give?*

And if you get these questions right, then life becomes — as the theorists of the Tanimbar islands might put it — *tastier*, and more worth living.
