In last week's piece, we explored how work might of benefit to us—how it might even be our salvation. For some thinkers, work is inherently  ennobling and self-improving. It is, as Carlyle put it, a “purifying  fire, wherein all poison is burnt up.” 

Even if we don't go as far as Carlyle, we have already seen that work can be beneficial in that it provides us with a range of both internal and external goods. Work  gives us a social context. If it is the right kind of work, it makes use of our skills in a satisfying way. It develops those skills further  (and developing skills is *fun*). It can be stimulating and enjoyable. And it enables us to provide for ourselves and those close to us. 

These are all good things. So there's no wonder that research shows that work can be an important factor contributing to the sense we might have that our lives are going well for us—what has come to be known as our  “subjective well-being.” And any account of work (for example,  Aristotle's) that ignores these positive aspects, and that doesn't pay  any attention to the internal and external goods that work provides is  going to fall short. 

Nevertheless, work is often burdensome, hard or even soul-destroying. When we talk about work, we sometimes do so  with excitement and enthusiasm, but equally frequently we do so with a  sense of frustration or heaviness. Work gets us down. 

Why is this the case, given all the research that shows how work is good for us? Is there something wrong with us? Are we just being perverse when we  complain about work? Or is  there a darker side to work? 

## The darker side of work

One recent thinker, the anthropologist David Graeber, believes there is. In his essay—and later his book—on the phenomenon of what he calls  “bullshit jobs”, Graeber talks about the “moral and spiritual damage” of our modern work-cultures. Our modern-day attitudes to work, Graeber  writes, constitute a “scar across our collective soul.” 

In this  piece, we're going to look at three ways in which our cultures of work  may be the cause of a kind of moral or spiritual damage: the first is  unemployment, the second is overwork, and the third is Graeber's  phenomenon of “bullshit jobs.”  

But first, I want to say  something about the term “spiritual.” When talking about the spiritual  damage caused by work, I don't mean anything mystical or religious (and  neither does Graeber). Instead, I am using the term “spiritual” to  capture the all-pervading effect our attitudes to work have on our  existence. When work gets us down, we feel *dispirited.* It feels as if *s*omething has left us: a sense of liveliness, hope, creativity, excitement.  “Spiritual” harm, in this sense, refers to the way that work can make  our lives less spirited, less lively, less full and rich and meaningful.

## On the spiritual harms of unemployment 

It is often argued that work is good for us because unemployment is so  clearly bad for us. In his book on the philosophy of work, Lars Svendsen cites A. Kim Burton and Gordon Waddell's report *Is Work Good for Your Health and Well-Being?* This report, commissioned by the British government and published in  2006, seems to provide robust support for the idea that working is good  for us, and that unemployment is correspondingly bad for us. Svendsen  summarises Burton and Waddell's findings as follows,

> In  terms of a negative effect on happiness, or “subjective well-being” as  it is often called in empirical studies, unemployment is one of the  things with the highest impact, along with serious illness and divorce.  It seems that loss of income is only a minor part of this and that other factors have greater impact than the purely economic ones. The  “typical” unemployed will have less social interaction with others and  lower self-esteem. People take unemployment personally. [1]

Unemployment deprives us of income, of status and of social interaction. No wonder  it is so destructive. The authors of the report conclude that,

> There is a strong evidence base showing that work is generally good for  physical and mental health and well-being. Worklessness is associated  with poorer physical and mental health and well-being. Work can be  therapeutic and can reverse the adverse health effects of unemployment.  [2]

This suggests that Benedict of Nursia was onto  something when—as we saw last time—he counselled that in the monastery,  “Brothers who are sick or weak should be given a type of work or craft  that will keep them busy without overwhelming them or driving them  away.” [3] And Burton and Waddell's report seems to provide pretty  compelling evidence that we're better off working than not working.

However, we need to look at this more closely, because this litany of the harms  of unemployment is a less compelling argument for the goodness of work  than it first seems.

One obvious benefit of work is that it provides us with income. Burton and Waddell write that for those who are unemployed, 

> Re-entering work (rather than simply moving off benefits) is generally associated  with improvement in income, socio-economic status, mental and general  health, and well-being. [4]

This is not surprising.  Having insufficient income to support ourselves and those who depend  upon us is a genuine harm. But the absence of income is not inherent to  being outside of a waged job. It is possible to envisage alternative  social systems—ones with substantial unemployment benefits, or where  there is some kind of universal basic income—that might mitigate these  harms of being out of work. The issue here is not the absence of work  itself, but the absence of sufficient income to live a life where one  can meet one's needs. 

Another benefit of work is that it gives us a concrete social (or socio-economic) status. We are social primates,  and status matters to us. But here again, we need to look more closely.  The reason that being outside of waged work entails an absence of status is that we live in a culture where one of the major determinants of  status is what waged work we do. If unemployment is seen as being  low-status—or even blameable—this is because we live in a culture that  places a huge moral value on waged work. The loss of status that goes  with unemployment is not due to the *absence of work*. It is due to a culture that sees work as the highest good, and unemployment as a state that is morally reprehensible.

Burton and Waddell's conclusions are not without nuance. They caution that  work is only better than unemployment if you have what they call a “good job”— a job that supports our health and well-being, and that gives us  sufficient autonomy to feel that we are active agents in the world.

But it's possible to turn this round, and to ask if there are “good “and  “bad” jobs, why there shouldn't be “good” and “bad” forms of  unemployment as well. In other words, the reason that unemployment is  bad for us is that we are committed to sustaining a system of *bad unemployment*, a system in which unemployment necessarily compromises health,  well-being, and autonomy. Arguably, a more humane political and social  system would ask not just how to make work good, but also unemployment.  It would be a system that saw some degree of support for our health,  well-being and autonomy not as things that we achieve when we enter the  world of work, but as the non-negotiable ground of our existence as  citizens.

## On the spiritual harms of overwork

Nevertheless, Burton and Waddell's caution about “good jobs” is important. Because  while we can find meaning and purpose in work, not all jobs will enable  us to do this. And this leads us to another potential spiritual harm  caused by work: the harm of simply working too hard. In a culture that  is driven by an overarching work ethic, a culture that sees work as a  path to virtue, it is easy to see how overwork can become a problem. The harder we work, the more virtuous we feel ourselves to be. We are  encouraged to compete with each other for the status that comes from  being the most virtuous and the most hard-working. And in cultures such  as this, being worn out and ragged  is seen as a badge of virtue. 

This, of course, comes at significant cost. But it is not inevitable that we  view work like this. We've already seen one philosopher—Aristotle—who is sceptical about the value of work, and who sees work as something that  is “unchoiceworthy” and that we should limit as far as possible.  Meanwhile, over in China, the *Zhuangzi—*a text attributed to the 4th century BCE philosopher Zhuang Zhou—offers a fascinating insight into how we might work *differently*. 

![img](/images/zhuangzi.jpeg)Zhuang Zhou by a waterfall. [Via Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Zhangzi_in_front_of_waterfalls.jpg).

The *Zhuangzi* is sometimes represented as a kind of slacker text that encourages us  to bunk off work as much as we possibly can. But it is more interesting  than that. What the *Zhuangzi* encourages us to do is to think about what it means to work in a way that *nourishes our life* (the Chinese term for this is *yang sheng*). To nourish our life is to guard our energy and our vitality, whatever  activity we are engaged in. This idea of life as something to be  nourished is associated with the famous idea of *wu-wei*, which  is sometimes translated as “non-doing”, but which could be better  understood as optimally minimising our activity. The idea of *wu-wei* is that we should do *as little as we can to accomplish what we want to accomplish*, and no more. Because anything beyond this risks sapping our spirits and exhausting us. In his brilliant book, *Trying Not to Try*, Edward Slingerland writes,

> *Wu-wei* is characterized by an internal sense of effortlessness and unselfconsciousness, even though the person in *wu-wei* may actually be very active in the world. [5]

The Zhuangzi often presents *wu-wei* as a personal achievement. But if we care about the spiritual harms of  work, perhaps we need to think about how our cultures of work wear us  out and exhaust us, and put in place new approaches to work that are  rooted in the idea of optimally minimising our effort, so that we can  nourish our lives.  

## On the spiritual harms of bullshit

The final spiritual harm of work that I want to consider here is the  spiritual harm of what Graeber calls “bullshit jobs.” A bullshit job is a job which simply doesn't need to exist, a job that, while you are doing it, you know is fruitless, pointless or without any value. Graeber  defines it like this:

> a bullshit job is a form of  employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious  that even the employee cannot justify its existence. [6]

What is crucial to Graeber's definition is that the employee themselves has  this nagging suspicion—or this clear apprehension—that their job has no  actual value. Bullshit jobs are particularly weird because although they may be lucrative, and they may even entail nothing objectively  unpleasant (you may have a good salary, be in a warm office, have plenty of time on your hands, and nobody bothering you), they are still  strangely harmful. Their sheer pointlessness—the knowledge that if this  job disappeared entirely, the world would be more or less unchanged—is  somehow spiritually corrosive. 

Even many jobs that seem  objectively useful may seem to involve large amounts of  bullshit: in  other words, innumerable tasks that serve no obvious purpose, that are  there simply to keep us busy, or to make people look good, or to fulfil  meaningless criteria. And this bullshit is destructive of our  well-being. Graeber writes that,

> Bullshit jobs regularly  induce feelings of hopelessness, depression, and self-loathing. They are forms of spiritual violence directed at the essence of what it means to be a human being. [7]

Why is this? Graeber argues that  it is because we need the sense that we are having an appreciable effect on the world. For our life to be spiritually rich and meaningful, we  need to feel that we are *being a cause* in the world. When this is not the case, we lose our moorings.  

## Undoing spiritual damage

So here are three ways in which our culture of work can cause spiritual  damage. It can harm us by setting up a system where non-work is equated  with the misery and lack of agency that comes from unemployment. It can  harm us by simply wearing us out, so we can't do anything else. And it  can harm us by making us engage in tasks that have no benefit, so  eroding our sense of ourselves as beings who can have an effect on the  world.

 All three forms of spiritual harm share one  characteristic: they undermine our ability to act in the world on the  basis of our own creative agency. When we are unemployed, when we are  overworked, or when we are forced to engage in a pantomime of useful  work knowing all the time that our work is useless, what we have lost is the sense of ourselves as agents in the world, capable of creating  something new.

If this diagnosis is correct, then it becomes  possible to see the outlines of a more humane attitude to work. Perhaps  the question we should be asking is not whether work is in itself good  (like Carlyle) or bad (like Aristotle). Instead, we should be asking how we can transform our cultures of both work and non-work, so that we  build a society that leaves room for agency and creativity for all of  us.

To do this, we also need to think harder not just about work,  but also non-work. So this is what we'll be doing in the next two  articles, where we'll ask some deeper questions about two varieties of  non-work: play, and idleness.

## Questions

1. If unemployment is a spiritual harm (in the sense set out above), is this  essential to the state of being unemployed? Or is it a result of our  cultures of work? Why do you think this?
2. I have suggested that the idea of *wu-wei* is that we should do “*as little as we can to accomplish what we want to accomplish.”* How might this be a good thing? And how might it be a bad thing?
3. Do you have any experience of *wu-wei* in your own life?
4. Have you ever been in (or are you in) a bullshit job? If not, what  percentage of your current job (if you have one) would you say is  bullshit?
