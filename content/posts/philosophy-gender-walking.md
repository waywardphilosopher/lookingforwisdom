At Looking for Wisdom, we've been fans of Kathrine Cuccuru's work for a long time. Her project [A PhilosopHER Walks](https://aphilosopherwalks.wordpress.com/) aims to explore walking as a philosophical practice. But this is also project that, "subverts, transgresses, and reimagines the traditionally male freedom to walk."

Kathrine is Associate Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK, and an Associate Member of the Aesthetics Research Centre, University of Kent, Canterbury, UK, and has particular interests in gender and in the sublime.

From the comfort of our Wind&Bones armchairs, we tracked down Kathrine to ask her more about her project.
