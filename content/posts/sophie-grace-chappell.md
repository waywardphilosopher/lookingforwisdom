## On Philosophy, Mountains and Finding Your Deepest Impulse

Sophie Grace Chappell is a philosopher, a poet, a mountaineer and a trans  woman. She was born in Lancashire in 1964, and educated at Bolton School and Magdalen College, Oxford. She has taught at Oxford, UEA,  Manchester, and Dundee. Since 1998, she has lived in Dundee with her  family. 

Her last book is *Knowing What To Do* (OUP 2014), and her next book is *Epiphanies* (OUP 2022).

### Q: I’m always interested in how people end up becoming philosophers. What  was it that led you to philosophy? And what keeps you doing philosophy? 

Two things overdetermine both that I got into it, and that I keep doing it. One is that I’m an argumentative so-and-so. Like the chap in the Monty  Python sketch, “I like a good argument”. I enjoy debate, and thinking  things through, and getting the logical components interlocking smoothly in the machinery, or pointing out that in someone else’s machinery,  they don’t interlock smoothly. The competitive or combative or  aggressive aspect of philosophy. That’s the Rottweiler side of me, as I  sometimes put it.

But there’s another side to me. I also have what you might—if you’re a Nigel Molesworth fan—call a [Fotherington-Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Fotherington-Tomas) side, a “Hello clouds, hello sky” dreamy poetic side. A mystical side  maybe; certainly a contemplative side. And this moves me towards  philosophy too, only from the other direction as it were. I want to do  philosophy at the point where these two desires intersect: the desire to be precise and to call out imprecision and incoherence and flannel and  posturing codswallop, and the desire to be transcendent, to say  something that matters, that goes to the heart of things. I rather think that’s how Plato got to philosophy, too.

So of course you love it when you’re developing your own contemplative take on something. And if you’re gnarly-minded enough—I certainly am, and so was Plato—you love  it too when you’re taking a combative approach to someone else’s  contemplativeness. What I don’t enjoy—and Plato didn’t either!—is when  someone gets all combative about my contemplativeness… which no doubt  will happen when the book reviewers get to *Epiphanies*.

*Epiphanies* is a very Fotherington-Thomas sort of book. I have tried to  Rottweiler-proof it, to some extent; I certainly want it to be a  justification of a sort of contemplative approach to philosophy that  stands up to scrutiny. But not much can stand up to a really  determined—and unsympathetic—Rottweiler. When the reviews come out I’ll  just have to suck it up, I guess. Serves me right for dishing it out to  others so often, earlier in my career. (I like to think I’m less of a  Rottweiler than I used to be, though maybe that’s just self-deception.)



### Q: You are, as the *Guardian* has written, the UK’s only trans philosophy professor. I’d love to know about the deeper connections between your life as a philosopher and  your identity as a trans woman. Has philosophy helped you make sense of  these questions of identity? (And if so, how?)

What you immediately put me in mind of here is some remarks of Bernard Williams’ that I quoted in my [Stanford Encyclopedia article on him](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/williams-bernard/). At the outset of his writing career (I said there), Williams took for  his own “a phrase of D.H. Lawrence’s in his splendid commentary on the  complacent moral utterances of Benjamin Franklin: ‘Find your deepest  impulse, and follow that’” (1972: 93). Thirty years later he added, when looking back over his career, “If there’s one theme in all my work it’s about authenticity and self-expression… It’s the idea that some things  are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others  aren’t…. The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity.” Yes, that; very much that, about me and transgender. An  inner necessity, a need to be authentically and above all openly who I  actually am, is exactly what it’s all been about.

However, that doesn’t mean that I have a *theory* of transgender to offer. I doubt I do. For reasons I’ve been talking about in various publications, including *Knowing What To Do* and *Epiphanies*—and a lot of these reasons have quite a lot to do with lines of anti-theory argument in ethics that Bernard Williams pursued too—I tend to steer  away from philosophical theories of anything, at least in those parts of philosophy that aren’t best understood as handmaids of science. I think the real truth of things often eludes systematisation; even in science  too, actually.

And anyway, what is the theory supposed to *do*? Can we really not understand that murder is at least typically and  maybe always wrong, or that love is usually a good thing, or that  flowers are generally beautiful, till we have a philosophical theory  that explains why? And what is “explanation” here? Why is some set of  words, arranged in propositions with inferential relations between them, what we need to understand the goodness of love or the badness of  murder? That seems to me an odd picture of what understanding is.  Understanding, as I understand it, can be verbal and articulate, but  quite often it isn’t at all, and oftener still the propositionally  articulated bit isn’t the only part. Science limns the structure of  reality, as Quine says in *Word and Objec*t. Sure it does, at least if it’s any good; but so does poetry too, if *it’s* any good. There isn’t just one correct way to grasp the deep structure  of things; there are lots because there are lots of things we might call the deep structure of things. Propositional structures are great for  the understanding, but experience matters too, and experience is no less cognitive for being, sometimes, non-discursive and not expressible in  propositions.

Well, I feel the force of all these considerations  about theorising about transgender in particular. It should be  experience first, theory later—if at all. Also, with particular  reference to this case of transgender, I am always saying—because I  think it’s true—that trans people don’t owe cis people, or anyone else,  an explanation of why they’re who they are; any more than gay people do, for instance, or black people or Jewish people, or any other  historically stigmatised minority. Right now, there are far too many  people saying that we who are transgender have to prove our right to  exist before they’ll take us seriously or accept us as fellow human  beings. That’s the demand of which I think it’s right to say that there  should be no “transgender debate”. Our right to be ourselves is not up  for discussion. We shouldn’t be refused admission to society until we’ve arrived at a theory of transgender that is “satisfactory” (to whom?).

At the same time, by and large cis people who haven’t personally  encountered it don’t understand transgender. The commonest reaction is  probably “OK, fine; I don’t get it, but live and let live”. And people  like that *do* deserve an explanation, an account or an  elucidation or a story about us because they’re not just trying to knock us down; their lack of understanding is benign, and not wilful.

To people like them, what I suppose I want to say is something like this.  At least as I understand and experience it, being transgender is  fundamentally about finding that your body is one way, in my case the  male way, and you wish it were the other way, the female way. And if  you’re transgender that wish, that longing, is not a whim or a passing  fancy but an immensely powerful longing and yearning, and fundamental to your psyche. And it begins when you do. It’s not a sexual thing, it  goes much deeper than that, and for a lot of us, me included, it’s among the first things we were ever aware of. And if it is there, you can’t  make it go away by wanting to. I tried that, I saw it as my religious  and moral duty to try, for 33 years, and the pressure of the repressed  desire became absolutely intolerable. It was tearing me apart. So I had  to try something else. So after a rather confused decade, from about  2008 onwards I tried living as a woman: presenting as female, living in  society as a woman—or at least as a trans woman—and did it with  gradually increasing confidence and openness.

Now it doesn’t solve everything to do that. I mean, if it’s fundamental to your psyche that  you wish with all your heart that you’d been born female, but you’re  perfectly well aware that you weren’t, then there’s only so much that  can be done about that sense of mismatch. After a certain point, all  trans people have to accept a compromise; the only question is where  they’ll stop, and of course, the answers are different for different  individuals. But what is clearly true is that no other solution comes  anywhere near helping a trans person as much as it helps them to  transition.

And if you’re young enough, and if there aren’t  medical obstacles, no doubt that often means a full medical and surgical transition too. I was immensely struck by seeing on the internet  recently the sheer joy that it gives trans men to have “top surgery”, to have their bodies realigned to fit more closely with their sense of who they are. To deny trans people this sort of bodily autonomy, this sort  of choice over their own destinies—to insist that born biology is an  unbreakable and unalterable destiny, that the body is what Plato thought it was, a prison—that seems to me the height of callousness and  cruelty.

But here we are in the UK in a situation where in  practice it takes at least 5 years even to get to the beginning of the  NHS process of transgender healthcare, and where the same so-called  “gender critical” voices that have pushed the vulnerable trans minority  in our society into what is, for many individuals, a truly desperate  situation—people are committing suicide because of the suffering their  untreated gender dysphoria is causing them—those voices will be only too happy to make things even worse for transgender people if they get the  chance. And they might well get the chance, given this government’s  extraordinary willingness to engage in what they like to call culture  wars. If only there were less of this sort of toxicity and cruelty  around today.



### Q: Contrary to the usual image of a philosopher as somebody sedentary, you have a fondness for extreme sports, in particular mountaineering. In  what ways are philosophy and mountaineering alike? Or are they entirely  different things?

Well, I talked about philosophising out of a  coalescence of the instincts of a logician on the one hand, and of a  mystic on the other. You get the same interaction of potentially  conflicting impulses—and the same sort of resultant rows between  people—in climbing. Climbing is, in a way, about solving problems in  applied engineering. What application of what physical forces, at what  angles, with what leverage and what counterpoising, will enable me to  get this slow weak heavy body of mine to the top of this fantastic piece of smooth vertical rock? (Or, in winter, ice?) And how do I protect  myself as I go? But in another way, you might say that climbing is not  applied engineering at all; it’s more like a spiritual discipline—and it can be a mystical experience. I mean, if it wasn’t for the Wow Moments, the Peak Experiences, the Epiphanies, why would we climb at all? To  keep fit? To attract sexual partners? I don’t really think so.

The truth is, of course, that climbing is both engineering and epiphany at  once, and all my favourite writers on climbing register this bipolarity  in one way or another. W.H.Murray for example, whose *Mountaineering In Scotland* is both the diary of a techno-wonk precisian (by the standards of his  time: we’re a lot more techno-wonk-y now!) and also an elegy to a land  he longed for. (It was famously written by Murray in a prisoner-of-war  camp in Germany in 1944, on the only paper available to him,  toilet-roll; the guards confiscated it, so he wrote the whole thing out  again, on more toilet-roll.) Or again, my friend Stephen Venables—who is both a skilled woodworker and a passionate Chopin-player—writes  wonderfully in his various books both about the technical side of  climbing, and also about its epiphanic aspect. Or to name another  friend, Simon Richardson combines almost mathematically exact  route-descriptions with one of the most wonderful climbing-book titles I know, *Chasing The Ephemeral*. Climbing too is both technical  precision, and also dreamy elevation. Maybe that’s why I love it in its  different way just as much as I love philosophy—though I am definitely  less gifted on the climbing side than in philosophy, that’s for sure. 

## On Knowing What to Do

### Q: I want to talk about your book, *Knowing What to Do*, which argues for an approach to ethics that traces its roots back to  Plato. But first, I want to ask about your own relationship with Plato’s thought. When did your interest in Plato begin? And why? 

When I was growing up my family had in the house a copy of that old Penguin, *The Last Days Of Socrates*, with *Apology, Crito, Phaedo* in it. I expect it was my mother’s copy; she did an Open University  degree in English and Philosophy in the early seventies, despite already having a Manchester University degree in English. So I suppose I  started reading and rereading it when I was about 10. I was fascinated  by the idea of “following the argument wherever it goes”, and both  perplexed and excited by Socrates’ apparent confidence that that’s all  you need to do to get to the truth. And the Socrates-versus-Plato  dynamic intrigued me from the start. To use my terms above, Socrates was so clearly a Rottweiler, Plato so clearly a Fotherington-Thomas. I got  on to the idea that there was a deep divide between them, all by myself. I didn’t need to read the scholarship, or to know it even existed, to  see that Plato was putting things into Socrates’ mouth, in the *Phaedo* in particular. Because it just wasn’t—I reasoned—natural to suppose that we would get to *those* conclusions, like reincarnation and recollection and the Forms, simply by following  our logical noses. Those are conclusions of revelation, not of reason;  and being as I am a Christian, I was interested too in the question what beliefs you could get out of reason alone, and what beliefs needed  revelation to support them. But Plato, I thought—and think—never really  tried, in the *Phaedo*, seriously to suggest that he was getting  his “Socrates” to his conclusions by reason alone. There was plenty of  “as we know from those old-familiar arguments of ours” to be found in  the text. Plenty of appeal, too, to dreams and prophets and  fairy-stories.

Another thing that interested me straight away in  the arguments in Plato’s dialogues—I’m afraid it’s a bit meta—was about, so to speak, the granularity of the arguments. Socrates is very keen to proceed a single step of argument at a time. But what *counts* as a single step in argument, and why? Is logical space basically a continuum, so that  anyone who defines minima, pixels, atoms, unitary steps, within logical  space is making a particular decision about how to carve things up that  could have been decided otherwise? Or is logical space naturally and  essentially pixellated, atomic, granular?

At any rate it was very  obvious to me, when I read Plato, that what struck him as a basic unit  of inference, what he counted as a single step in the argument, was  different from what strikes us today. So what followed from that  difference? Well, it meant either that Plato had things all wrong—he was dividing logical space up *incorrectly.* Or that *we* have it all wrong, and Plato was right. Or that we and Plato are *both* wrong, and some third account of the basic structure of logical space is  available elsewhere, or is yet to be discovered. Or again, perhaps, that the very idea of logical space is a relativistic notion. That what you  count as a single step in argument is determined by some feature of your context. But then, if so, *which* feature?

The obvious suggestion is of course that it’s our languages that do the relativising. But if *that*’s right, then a whole research agenda hoves into view: we need to think  about how the language that we do philosophy in, affects—perhaps even  determines—the philosophy that we’re able to do. I didn’t really have  the vocabulary to express all this clearly when I was 12 or 14 (perhaps I still don’t). But I do think these considerations give us one reason  why it’s essential for philosophers not to be monoglots. We should  always be wary of the language that we work in, whether English or  German or propositional calculus or whatever. We should never allow  people to talk about “ordinary-language philosophy” or “linguistic  intuitions” without retorting “*Which* language?” We should never stop pushing the question “What does my own medium for thought obscure  from my own thinking?” I think this wariness about language and logic is one of the best things that reading Plato in Greek can give you. Though of course you can also get it by reading Kant in German, or Descartes  in French, or Augustine in Latin. Or [Laozi](/laozi) or Advaita Vedanta in Chinese or Sanskrit (I don’t read either, unfortunately).

So these were aspects of Plato’s works that interested me straight away  when I was 10 or 12 years old—and still interest me today. Above all:  the idea of getting to the Platonic heaven simply by question-and-answer argument: well, wow. It might not actually *work*, but what an incredible wheeze. I say something about that, too, towards the end of *Epiphanies.*



### Q. At the outset of  *Knowing What to Do*, you talk about the failure of systematic moral theories. What are systematic moral theories? And why do you think they fail? 

A systematic moral theory is, roughly, an approach to thinking about what to do which derives conclusions about what to do in particular cases  from the most general possible principles about what to do in any case  whatever, and which aspires to give the greatest possible number of  explanations and justifications of action on the basis of the smallest  possible of theoretical posits, axioms, or assumptions. The most  familiar examples of systematic moral theory in this sense are the  various forms of Kantianism, consequentialism, contractualism, natural  law theory, and so on; virtue ethics can sometimes be presented as a  systematic moral theory too.

I say more—a lot more, 220,000 words more—about all this in *Epiphanies.* But very briefly, a theory like that fails for reasons that Bernard  Williams and David Wiggins put very well in this passage from their  introduction to Aurel Kolnai’s collected essays:

> In  science theorists hope to find a few principles from which everything  else will be deducible. There are more serious reasons than purely  aesthetic for wanting that—clarity, the hope that the drive towards it  will reveal error wherever it exists, the subsumption of many diverse  phenomena under one satisfying description. But in the case of moral  philosophy what defines the subject is a highly heterogeneous set of  human concerns, many of them at odds with many others of them, many of  them incommensurable with many others of them. In this case there is no  reason to think that what is needed is a theory to discover underlying  order. This is not a subject after all where very much is hidden. Or  rather what is hidden is hidden in a psychological or interpretive  sense. There is no question of a secret axiological ordering principle.  There is no deeper level of reality, comparable to the microscopic or  sub-microscopic level explored by chemistry and physics, which it is the moral philosopher’s duty to probe. And where one can make no sense of  there being such a level, the idea, urged by some moral philosophers, of finding the “simplest theory” which “will save the phenomena” (in the  normal acceptation of the phrase) is nearly meaningless.



### Q: As an alternative approach, you talk about the moral imagination. It  might be tempting to boil this down to something systematic as well;  but your own position seems much more baggy, generous and unsystematic. So, speaking unsystematically, what do you mean by moral imagination?

This is difficult to answer briefly, because, yes, I *am* speaking unsystematically when I talk about moral imagination. I mean lots of different things by the phrase. In Chapter 2 of *Knowing What To Do* I picked out three. One is something like empathy, the ability to put  yourself in someone else’s shoes; I get into that by beginning from a  contrast between two people encountering an alien race—one of them is  Patrick Leigh Fermor and the other is Adolf Hitler. The other two things I mean are in different ways both about the ability to question the  framing of a moral question, in particular a moral question that is  presented as a dilemma that is supposed to lead us to general  theoretical conclusions, like ticking-bomb scenarios or trolley  problems. About problems like that I find I very often want to say  “Never mind what the answer is; why are we accepting the question?” Why, that is, should we accept the whole way the problem is framed for us,  as if there were something neutral or inevitable about that? That, as  Wittgenstein might put it, is where the sleight of hand, the conjuror’s  trick, has happened *already*: in the way the question was set up, which, unfortunately for us, we never thought to query. In this sense I think contemporary moral theory is full of leading questions. And I’m deeply suspicious of leading questions.

By saying that we can pick out these three kinds of moral imagination, I  didn’t at all mean that they’re the only kinds. Far from it. And in any  case, another thing I’m deeply suspicious of in contemporary moral  theory is allegedly comprehensive catalogues of types of things; they  almost never turn out to be *truly* comprehensive, and then people contort themselves gratuitously to save the quite unnecessary assumption that they *have to be* comprehensive. But there are other possibilities for what we might mean by “moral imagination”. In the new book, in *Epiphanies*, I have a fair bit to say about how the imagination feeds off, is  psychically nourished by, the kinds of permanent image for the soul that Jung calls an archetype; this happens with art and religion in  particular. But also, and I developed this idea in the last chapter of *Knowing What To Do,* simply to truly understand anything that confronts us is an exercise of the imagination, too: it is a kind of Murdochian attention or  attentiveness.



### Q: One of the things that you get from Plato is the role of contemplation  in developing moral imagination. What does it mean to contemplate? And  how do you go about it practically? 

Like I say, it’s about attention, about fixed and undivided still *gazing* upon something. Murdoch talks about this in *The Sovereignty of Good*, and it’s hard to improve on what she said there. It’s a spiritual  discipline; it’s an encounter with reality; and it’s a kind, perhaps the central kind, of love. We fix our minds with an effort at love and  truthfulness and justice on what is there, what is really there, before  us. To understand is to become still to ourselves, and still in  ourselves; and alive to the object of attention, *outside* our selves. This is also, I think, what poets do, or try to do. It’s certainly what I attempt in my own poetry.

Is it too pretentious to try and show what I mean by citing, indeed *re*citing, a poem that I wrote? This poem is about two of my own children as  pet-keepers, and how I saw, in them and in their care for their pets—as  it happened to be, a goldfish and a stick-insect—just this kind of  contemplative love.

### Q: As we are talking about moral imagination, it strikes me that the  inability to accept the experience of those who identify as transgender  is, in large part, a failure of the moral imagination. If so, how do we  move forward from here?

I think that’s right: the debate has got  bogged down in a kind of dogmatism, a kind of refusal to listen to  transgender people. How do we move forward? Well, we stop refusing to  listen, and start listening.

One *very* obvious arena where this needs to happen is the British press. The papers at present are full of articles *about* transgender people; but these articles are hardly ever *by* transgender people. Our voices are ignored or suppressed, and we personally are demonised and dehumanised. There isn’t a *subtle* or *complicated* solution to this problem. It just needs to stop. It simply needs to change.

## On Friendship, Epiphanies and Writing and Reading What You Want

### Q: What’s next on the horizon for you and your work?

*Epiphanies* will, I hope, be out before too long, and certainly in 2022 at the latest.  It’s a book about peak experiences, Wow moments and Aha moments, and  what they might be for ethical philosophers; how we might build a  philosophical outlook that takes these experiences seriously. So that’s  in the pipeline. So too is a volume of my poems! *Songs For Winter Rain*; I’m not sure when that will actually appear, but fairly soon, I think. It has “Two Pets” in it.

Philosophically, right now, I am thinking about how to take forward the philosophical programme that *Epiphanies* advances. It’s the same programme as I was already pursuing in *Ethics and Experience* and *Knowing What To Do*, only, as Hegel would say, things come to self-consciousness as they  unfold. You get clearer about what it is that you’re trying to do, as  you carry on doing it.

There’s also a short book on Friendship to  be written, contracted to CUP. How that will go, and how much it will  connect with the philosophical agenda of *Epiphanies*, I really have no idea. I’m certainly not going to *force* the friendship book to be somehow on the same page as the stuff on  epiphanies. Maybe it belongs there and maybe it doesn’t; who knows?

This is the great thing about philosophy, and what keeps me going at it:  it’s so unpredictable. I simply have no idea where the argument might  lead me. But nearly always, so far, to a good place.



### Q: Finally, if you could give any advice to an aspiring philosopher, what would it be?

Two things, I think. They both sound a bit defiant-individualist, and I  don’t want to lean too far into that, because philosophy is and should  be a dialectical and conversational enterprise, and so it does matter  what feedback other people give you.

However, philosophy as it  is—I mean mainly academic philosophy, but it’s more widely true than  that—is a real hall of mirrors: everyone is looking for everyone else’s  approval all the time, and that kind of peer pressure becomes not just  intellectually stultifying but institutionally tyrannical as well.

So first, read the books and papers, and write the books and the papers,  that you want to read and to write, not that other people tell you to.

And secondly: don’t measure yourself by other people’s measures of status.  Don’t play the hall of mirrors game. What matters is whether the work  you produce is any good. Measure yourself by that. And while philosophy  is unendingly difficult and demanding, don’t be too hard on yourself.
