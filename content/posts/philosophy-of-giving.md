+++

So, in those countries where Christmas is celebrated, it's getting to  that time of year when the eternal philosophical problem presents  itself: *what should I get as a gift for Uncle Pedro?

Last year's socks didn't go down well: he didn't wear them even once. Then  there was the debacle with the chocolate (how had you never known that  Uncle Pedro was allergic to cocoa beans)? As for the six-volume boxed  set of Proust that you bought him, he hasn't even cracked the spine on  the first volume.

But the more you think about the perennial  problem that is Uncle Pedro, the more the philosophical questions  multiply. What is this curious thing that you feel compelled to do every year at around this time? Why this frenzy of buying and giving things  that nobody seems to need? What is the point? Is it generosity or  compulsion? Why that sense of overwhelming obligation, that knowledge  that you *can't not* buy Uncle Pedro something, even if you're pretty sure he's going to hate whatever it is you buy.

## The mighty Mauss

If you have ever been perplexed by questions like these, particularly  around this time of year,  you could do worse than turn to the work of  Marcel Mauss. In 1925, the philosopher and sociologist published his *Essai sur le don*, or “Essay on the Gift.” The essay drew on a huge range of sources,  including ethnographic data from Polynesia and the Pacific Northwest of  America, and ancient German and Roman law, to explore the universal  human institution of gift exchange.

This breadth of sources was  typical of Mauss. He was a prodigiously gifted writer. He learned Māori  and Sanskrit. He was famous as a storyteller, and was a teacher with  considerable charisma. And his intellectual interests were seemingly  omnivorous: he studied everything from anthropology, to the nature of  prayer, to magic, to the ethnography of the Inuit peoples.

But it  is his essay on the gift for which he remains most famous today. Mauss's essay explores the complexity and hidden dynamics of human gift-giving. And at the centre of Mauss's argument is the idea that in gift-giving,  there is a disjunction between what seems to be going on, and what is  actually going on, between appearance and reality.

Gift-giving is something that is *apparently* enacted out of pure generosity. We give gifts *as if* we are acting freely (this may recall the [earlier Looking for Wisdom piece](/philosophy-of-ritual/) on the subjunctive, or “as if” nature of ritual…). But in reality, what is going on in gift-giving is a “strict accounting system” that  involves an “intricate mingling of symmetrical and contrary rights and  duties.” [1]

Think about what happens when Christmas comes around, and you start thinking as usual about Uncle Pedro. You rack your brains to think of an appropriate gift. After all, you *have* to get him something. But what?

For Mauss, this sense of obligation — this “have to” — is central to all  gift-giving. It it not just an obligation to give. It is also an  obligation to receive (if Uncle Pedro rejected your gift, refusing to  play the game of giving and receiving, you would find him blameable —  and, to be honest, you are still sore about the multi-volume Proust  set). And it is also the obligation to reciprocate (which means that you can take some scant comfort from the fact that Uncle Pedro is having  exactly the same difficulties, because the rules of the game are that he *has* to give you something in return).

What does this add up to? For Mauss, this constant cycle of gift-giving, this symmetry of  obligations, of gifts and counter-gifts, is a way of balancing social  accounts, while also maintaining and reaffirming social relationships.  We give gifts to cement social solidarity, but all the time we are  watching our backs to make sure we are not being taken for mugs, and  that Uncle Pedro is not getting away with stinginess.

## The economics of giving

Mauss's view of the gift has become central to anthropological understandings  of what is going on when we exchange gifts. But it raises a problem.  Where does this leave the actual urge to generosity?

Before Mauss, it might have been possible to distinguish between the unfree  compulsion of market economies, and the freedom of gift-giving. But  Mauss seems to suggest that there is nothing that escapes the logic of  mutual accounting. So where does this leave the impulse to pure  generosity, or giving for its own sake, free of any expectation of  return?

This puzzle is one that the philosopher Jacques Derrida takes up in his book *Given Time: 1. Counterfeit Money*.

The problem, as Derrida puts it, is that the moment we are aware of something *as* a gift, we are entering into a system of mutual accounting. A real gift, a true gift, would break with this circle of reciprocity, symmetry and  mutual exchange. A true gift is one that doesn't circulate, that is not  exchanged for anything else.

So the question is this: is there  anything, anywhere, that breaks with economic reason in this way?  Derrida puts the question like this:

> If there is a gift,  the given of the gift (that which one gives, that which is given, the  gift is given thing or as act of donation) must not come back to the  giving. It must not circulate, it must not be exchanged, it must not in  any case be exhausted, as a gift, by the process of exchange by the  movement of circulation of the circle in the form or return to the point of departure. [2]

For example, let's say that I take in a foster cat because I am kind-hearted. Although it may seem like an act  of generosity, this kind-heartedness is not disinterested, because I  also get a cat to snuggle on cold winter evenings. My apparent  generosity is also a kind of exchange: shelter for snuggles.

Or to take another example, imagine somebody stops me on the street and  asks for money. As it is a sunny day, and I'm in a good mood, I give  them a ten-dollar bill. They thank me. We have a pleasant exchange, and  both go on our way, a spring in our strides.

For the rest of the  morning, I feel good about myself. And no wonder: from my apparent gift, all kinds of good things flow back to me — this good feeling, this  sense of my own moral worth, this pleasure of connection with another  person. So, if you were inclined to burst my bubble, you might be  tempted to ask: isn't this just a more elaborate kind of economy or  exchange? And if it is, then can it really be said to be a gift at all?

And this is why Derrida comments drily that Mauss's essay — with its  meticulous exploration of exchange, economy and mutual obligation —  talks about everything but the gift. Because surely a gift is something *other than* exchange and economic reason.

## Impossible gifts

So where does this leave the idea of the gift? Well, as usual with  Derrida, it's complicated. Because any acknowledgement of a gift, on the part of either the giver or the recipient, necessarily sucks us back  into the circle of economic exchange. Whatever we get in return —  whether we receive material goods, social goods or even spiritual goods — we are still in the realm of exchange. We are still dealing with some  kind of economy. And this annuls the gift-nature of the gift. 

For there to be a true gift, Derrida argues, the gift would have to not  appear as a gift, either to the giver or to the recipient. Or if it  appeared, it would have to be immediately effaced and forgotten. Because every time we acknowledge something as a gift, we find ourselves  falling back into a cycle of exchange. This is why Derrida says, in his  usual teasing way: 

> These conditions of possibility of  the gift (that some "one" gives some "thing" to some "one other")  designate simultaneously the conditions of the impossibility of the  gift. [3]

Now, all this is the kind of thing that makes certain kinds of philosophers grumble and mutter, “What *are* you talking about, Jacques?” And to make sense of it, you have to get  on board with the spirit of what Derrida is up to. On the one hand, he  wants to appeal to our hunches that there *are* gifts, that  economics isn't everything, that there is something that escapes the  economic order. But on the other hand, he wants to show how hard it is  to articulate what it might mean to escape this economic order.

For Derrida's opponents, this may look very much like a vacuous  intellectual game, mere playing with words. But seeing it like this does Derrida a disservice. The real force of what Derrida is saying is  ethical. He is pushing against the complacency with which we come to the judgement, “Yes, this is good, this is ethical, this is generous.”  Derrida wants to trouble our ethical complacency, opening up a space for unease and uncertainty. He is not cynically giving up on the idea of  the gift altogether, and reducing everything down to self-interest.  Instead, he is trying to provoke us to maintain a genuinely ethical  vigilance, in the middle of all our calculations and judgements. It is  as if he is saying: let us go on giving, aware of the complexity this  involves, refusing to rest easy in the image of our own goodness, but  open to the possibility (however impossible) of a generosity beyond the  reach of economic reasoning. 

Next time, we're going to look at  perspectives from elsewhere that take a different view on gift-giving:  from the religious traditions of South Asia and indigenous cultures in  Southeast Asia. We're going to ask whether we need to follow Derrida to  this tangled, difficult conclusion. And we will be thinking not in terms of economic circles, but instead of spirals. I'll see you then!
