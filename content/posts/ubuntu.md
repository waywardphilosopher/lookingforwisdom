## Truth, Reconciliation, and Ubuntu

The day after Christmas day last year marked the death of Desmond Mpilo  Tutu (1931 - 2021), the Nobel Prizewinner, anti-apartheid activist and  former archbishop of Cape Town.

Tutu's life was extraordinary, as  is his legacy. Born in 1931 to Tswana and Xhosa parents, he studied  theology in London before returning to his native South Africa, where he became a powerful voice in the fight against apartheid.

When I  was growing up in the 1980s, Tutu was a familiar figure on the evening  news: unstoppable, ebullient, fierce and uncompromising. In 1986, he was appointed Archbishop of Cape Town, and after the fall of apartheid,  Nelson Mandela appointed him to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In his book *No Future Without Forgiveness*, Tutu wrote of how  the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was an attempt to balance,  “justice, accountability, stability, peace, and reconciliation” while  attempting to set out a public account of the horrors of the apartheid  regime. [1]

Since Tutu's death, I've been thinking again about his work, and also about its philosophical underpinnings. Because Tutu was  responsible for helping to disseminate and popularise a philosophical  concept that has since become widespread (and has also lent its name to a [popular distribution](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) of the Linux operating system): and that concept, of course, is the concept of *ubuntu*.

I've been wanting to write more about African philosophical traditions for a while here on Looking for Wisdom. So, this seems to be a good time to  launch into this idea of *ubuntu*, to ask what it means, and why it matters.

## What is Ubuntu?

The term *ubuntu* (and its variants) is found in languages from the Bantu language family. It is made up of two parts: the root *ntu*, and the prefix *ubu*. The root means something like “entity” or “object”, while the prefix *ubu* (or *mu*) simply means “human.” So the term as a whole suggests the entity that  is a human being. As such, it is both descriptive, in that it suggests  what human beings are, and it is prescriptive, in that it suggests what  human beings should be. Or, to put it in fancier philosophical language, it is both ontological (it talks about the nature of human being), and  it is ethical (it talks about what it is for this particular being,  human being, to be good).

Scholarly references to the term *ubuntu* and its equivalents go back to the middle of the twentieth century.  And perhaps one of the most famously concise glosses of the term is  that from the philosopher John Mbiti. For Mbiti, *ubuntu* can be captured by the idea “I am because we are, and since we are, therefore, I am.” Mbiti explained the concept like this:

> Only in terms of other people does the individual become conscious of his  own being, his own duties, his privileges and responsibilities towards  himself and towards other people. When he suffers, he does not suffer  alone but with the corporate group; when he rejoices, he rejoices not  alone but with his kinsmen, his neighbors and his relatives whether dead or living. [2]

## Tutu's Ubuntu

It is this reading of Ubuntu that became a central peg of Tutu's own  philosophy and theology. And while the idea of Ubuntu had deep roots in  Bantu language-speaking communities, it was Tutu more than anyone who  popularised the term, and gave it a contemporary religious, ethical,  philosophical and political urgency. In his short essay, 'Ubuntu: On the Nature of Human Community', Tutu wrote as follows:

> IN OUR AFRICAN *weltanschauung*, our worldview, we have something called *ubuntu*. In Xhosa, we say, “Umntu ngumtu ngabantu.” This expression is very  difficult to render in English, but we could translate it by saying, “A  person is a person through other persons.” We need other human beings  for us to learn how to be human, for none of us comes fully formed into  the world. We would not know how to talk, to walk, to think, to eat as  human beings unless we learned how to do these things from other human  beings. For us, the solitary human being is a contradiction in terms.
>
> Ubuntu is the essence of being human. It speaks of how my humanity is caught  up and bound up inextricably with yours. It says, not as Descartes did,  “I think, therefore I am” but rather, “I am because I belong.” I need  other human beings in order to be human. The completely self-sufficient  human being is subhuman. I can be me only if you are fully you. I am  because we are, for we are made for togetherness, for family. We are  made for complementarity. We are created for a delicate network of  relationships, of interdependence with our fellow human beings, with the rest of creation.
>
> I have gifts that you don’t have, and you have gifts that I don’t have. We are different in order to know our need of  each other. To be human is to be dependent. [3]

Recently, there has been a huge amount of philosophical work on the concept of *ubuntu*: far more than can be summarised in a short article. But for present purposes, it is worth looking at two aspects of *ubuntu*: the ontological aspect that asks what it means to be a person, and the  ethical aspect that asks how we ought to live in the light of this. 

## Ubuntu and personhood

The first aspect of *ubuntu*, then, is a claim about the nature of personhood. For those brought up  in cultures that are relatively individualistic, it is easy to imagine  that we are born as individuals, unique and distinct, and that we gather together into societies to help meet our individual needs: for company, for connection, for security, for material well-being. In this kind of  view, individuals come first. They are logically prior to the societies  that they form and the social contracts that they make.

But the notion of *ubuntu* turns this on its head, reversing this order of priority. First, there is  society. And our uniqueness, individuality, and personhood are all born  out of this social connectedness. Taking the perspective of *ubuntu*, it makes no sense to ask about how individuals come together to form  societies. We are, all of us, irreducibly bound up in social  connections, webs and networks of material dependence, language, myth,  story, and imagination. Even if we retire to the mountains to live as  hermits, we are still, at root, irreducibly social beings. And being a  hermit is not a refusal of society, but instead simply another way of  living in relation to society.

This is the ontological claim of *ubuntu* philosophy. Society is not just an add-on, or an afterthought, or a set of necessary and regrettable compromises. Instead, it is the cradle of  our personhood. And this ontological claim seems to me to be  plausible–far more plausible, in fact, than the idea that individual  personhood comes first. Our being in the world, as the German  philosopher Martin Heidegger once put it, is a being-with-others (*Mitsein*). 

## Ubuntu and ethics

But *ubuntu* philosophy doesn't just involve ontological claims. It also involves  claims about how we ought to be, given that this is who we are. Here's  Tutu again,

> In traditional African society, *ubuntu* was coveted more than anything else—more than wealth as measured in  cattle and the extent of one’s land. Without this quality a prosperous  man, even though he might have been a chief, was regarded as someone  deserving of pity and even contempt. It was seen as what ultimately  distinguished people from animals—the quality of being human and so also humane.
>
> Those who had ubuntu were compassionate and gentle, they used their strength on behalf of the weak, and they did not take  advantage of others—in short, they cared, treating others as what they  were: human beings. If you lacked ubuntu, in a sense you lacked an  indispensable ingredient of being human. [4]

For Tutu, if we are indeed interdependent to the very root of our being, this means  that we have irreducible obligations to others. But in meeting these  irreducible obligations, it is not a question of the trade-off between  self-interest and other-interest.

If we conceptualise society as a group of individuals entering a social contract, then to be in society  always involves trading in some of our self-interest for the benefits  that society may bring. In this view, society always involves a balance  of competing interests.

But the idea of *ubuntu* holds a  more radical possibility: the possibility of finding a way of living in  society that augments the interests of everyone. This is an idea that  goes beyond an ethics of consensus or accommodation, to an idea of  mutual flourishing and uplift. And in this way, it offers a challenge to find new and creative forms of political organisation that might serve  this mutual flourishing.

Tutu's own work is a testimony to this.  Later, writing about restorative justice and about the horrors of the  testimonies gathered by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, he  claimed that, “Ubuntu (and so restorative justice) gives up on no one.  No one is a totally hopeless and irredeemable case.” Because ultimately, to give up on anyone is to give up on interdependence, and it is to  give up on the possibility of community.

And if is something  perhaps utopian in this, Tutu's own example reminds us that it is not an easy or naive utopianism. It is, instead, a robust and tough-minded  kind of hope. a determination to find better ways of flourishing as the  determinedly, irreducibly social beings that we are.
