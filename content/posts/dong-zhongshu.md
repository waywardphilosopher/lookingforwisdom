## Chronicles and Caterpillars

If there's anything that we can predict with certainty about the course of history, it is that history is unpredictable. This is an insight that  was central to the thought of the Chinese philosopher Dong Zhongshu  (董仲舒).

Dong was born some time around 198 BCE in Guangchuan, now  in present-day Hebei. What we know about his life comes from a couple of sources. First, a few scrappy references in the *Shiji* (史記) or *Records of the Grand Historian*, by the historian Sima Qian (司馬遷). And second, the longer account of his life in the Han Shu (漢書) by the scholar Ban Gu (班固).

Dong Zhongshu was a thinker with broad intellectual interests, and a determinedly synthesising sensibility. He drew together [Confucianism](/confucius/), [yin and yang theory](/zou-yan/), an interest in politics, and an abiding concern with history. And when  it came to history, what fascinated him most was the sheer *oddness* of how history unfolds, the unpredictable, uncertain nature of events.

From an early age, Dong was fascinated by the *Chunqiu* (春秋), or *Spring and Autumn Annals*, a chronicle of the state of Lu. The *Chunqiu* sets out, with incredible compression, the history of Lu from the year  722 BCE to the year 481 BCE. It is made up of the briefest of  annotations, on average, no more than ten characters long. For example,  here is the section  recording a series of events in 688 BCE.

> In summer, in the sixth month, Shuo, the Prince of Wei, entered Wei.
> In autumn, our lord arrived from the attack on Wei.
> There was an infestation of caterpillars. [1]

This is typical for the *Chunqiu*: brief notes about who is attacking whom, what the harvest is doing, and unexpected events.

This laconic chronicle was the basis for a number of more extended commentaries, the most famous of which is the *Zuozhuan*, the largest extant text from pre-imperial China.

Dong Zhongshu was deeply familiar with the *Chunqiu* and its commentaries, and his scholarship was widely admired. His  reputation as a scholar led to his appointment as an academician. And he was almost the archetypical bookworm: Sima Qian tells us that for a  period of three years, he was so wrapped up in his work that nobody ever even saw him venture out into the garden.

When the emperor Wudi  came to the throne, Dong was appointed Chancellor of the kingdom of  Jiangdu. According to Ban Gu, Dong was a successful advisor who “never  failed to get the results for which he hoped.” [2] But things soon  turned sour in the palace. Dong Zhongshu was dismissed from his post –  it is not clear why – and demoted to Palace Counsellor.

After his  demotion, he doubled down on his study of unexpected and anomalous  events. This enthusiasm for anomalies was almost his undoing. During his time as Palace Counsellor, fires broke out in a shrine dedicated to  Gaozu, the founder of the Han dynasty. Dong Zhongshu, being the scholar  he was, jotted down notes on these unexpected happenings. Shortly  afterwards, his rival Zhufu Yan (主父偃) found the notes and took them to  Wudi. The emperor consulted a number of scholars and officials, and Dong Zhongshu fell under suspicion of disloyalty. These were, after all,  deeply inauspicious events – so what was Dong Zhongshu doing scribbling  secretive little notes about them? He was sentenced to death by a  committee of scholar-officials, only to be reprieved by the emperor.

Unsurprisingly, this put Dong off both politics and his enthusiasm for writing about  the strange and unexpected. After his fall from grace, he was offered a  position as advisor to Liu Duan, the king of Jiaoxi and the elder  brother of emperor Wudi. Liu was known for his dissolute ways of life,  and his fondness for arbitrarily executing his officials. Dong feigned  illness and refused the post. He spent the rest of his days at home,  occasionally taking visitors from the court seeking his advice, but  keeping the world of politics at arm's length. He died in old age, some  time around the year 107 BCE. [3]

## The Call of the Weird

Dong's abiding obsession with the role that anomalous, chance and unexpected events played in human life owed a lot to the *Chunqiu*. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* paid particular attention to omens, portents, and anomalies. Here, for  example, is a section recording events in 644 BCE, where there are some  inauspicious omens sighted in the skies above the city.

> In the sixteenth year, in spring, in the royal first month, on the *wushen* day, the first day of the month, stones fell from the sky in Song, five in  number. This same month, six fishhawks flew backward across the Song  capital. [4]

Dong was fascinated by these accounts. What could we take from anomalous  events? How could we understand them? Things like hawks flying backwards (no doubt due to high winds) are only more obvious examples of the more general truth that history is made up of one unexpected event after  another. And part of the fascination of the *Chunqiu* for Dong  Zhongshu was the way it made clear the sheer oddness of history, the way that another natural disaster or unanticipated happening always lurks  just around the corner. 

For Dong Zhongshu, this meant that one of the crucial arts of government was seeking to understand, as best one  could, the deeper patterns underlying apparently anomalous events.  Dong's hunch was this: if we can embrace and understand this weirdness  and unpredictability, then we might have some chance of offsetting its  harms, and taking advantage of the changeability of things.

## The Disorder of the World

Dong also took from the *Zuozhuan* the idea that disasters and anomalies were signs that the world was fundamentally disordered. But the *Zuozhuan* also suggested that the ultimate source of this disorder was a *social*. Dong took seriously the claim made in the *Zuozhuan* that events like fishhawks flying backward (because of high winds) and stones falling from the sky, were,

> matters of yin and yang and not matters in which one can locate the auspicious  or the inauspicious. Auspiciousness and inauspiciousness arise from  human beings. [5]

Put otherwise, the world is a chaotic  place because of the way that we intervene in the world. Bad government  has a habit of throwing things out of sync. And so when anomalies occur, Dong argued, they remind us that the world stands in need of some  remedial action. Events such as these can act as a call to begin working on reordering the world, by restoring a more just and judicious system  of government. In the *Chunqiu fanlu* (春秋繁露), or *Luxuriant Gems of the Spring and Autumn*, attributed to Dong Zhongshu, it says:

> Heaven conveys its warning to decadent polities by way of disasters in the  hope that those who manage them will reform their ways and with the  intention that those regimes will be saved from destruction thanks to  the encouragement of learning and of the right sort of action. [6]

## Bad government and black swans

This raises the question: what *is* the right sort of action? Here, Dong drew upon *yin-yang* theory, but gave this theory a moral slant. He associated *yang* with virtue (*de* 德), and with life, “as seen at the height of summer.” Meanwhile, he associated *yin* with punishment (*xing* 刑) and with the closure or ending of life, “as seen in the depths of  winter.” This led him to argue that effective rule should be rooted not  in punishment, but instead in virtuous acts that contributed to the  flourishing of life. 

Here, it is interesting to ask whether  Dong's view has any merit. It is clear that he overstates the case for  human agency. Not everything that happens is our fault. At the same  time, he understates the extent to which the world is *genuinely* anomalous, and unexpectedness is simply the way of things. Even with an ideal political and social order, we would not escape this  unpredictability.

Nevertheless, there are also genuine insights  here. The first is that we can understand a lot about the world by  reflecting on the fact that history is far more unpredictable, far more  made up of anomalies and chance events, than we might hope. Dong would  no doubt agree with Nassim Nicholas Taleb when he argues that to  understand history, we need to get to grips with so-called “black  swans”, improbable events with enormous consequences.

The other  insight is that the knock-on effects of unvirtuous government may be  both wide-ranging and unexpected. Droughts, fires, floods may *seem* like natural disasters; but many of these things may also have their roots,  at least in part, in human agency. Bad government can amplify the bad  effects of living in a world that is never wholly predictable. Good  government can diminish these bad effects.

And here Dong Zhongshu  might offer us a challenge, as we face our current climate disaster: the challenge of asking what it might mean to rule in a way that  contributes to life's flourishing.
