## Does philosophy change our minds?

Philosophers talk a lot about the power of reasoned argument to change our minds.  The whole discipline of philosophy, to an extent, depends on the idea  that this is how argument works.

But there's a problem with this  idea. Because one thing that you notice if you hang around philosophers  for a while is that in practice, they don't change their minds very  often. Surely, one might think, if reasoned debate were really this  transformative, then their skill in the use of reason would lead to them changing their minds with a quicksilver frequency that would put the  rest of us to shame. They'd be hard to pin down, slippery as fish,  constantly on the move. But it doesn't seem to work like this. Instead,  philosophers (or at least the ones I know) seem, if anything, to change  their minds *less* than non-philosophers. 

Perhaps this is  not surprising. Philosophers spend a lot of time and energy defending  their arguments. And after all this effort, when everything that you  thought you knew turns out to be wrong, or when the edifice of your  beliefs begins to crumble, then it's hard to face up to this. There's  something uniquely difficult about changing your mind, even more so when you have staked your entire life and reputation on a particular set of  arguments or beliefs. Changing your mind can make new enemies of those  who once considered you a friend. And it can invite ridicule. Think of  how politicians are held to account by the media for changing their  mind, and how these reversals are referred to as “humiliating U-turns.”

So in this philosopher file, we're going to look at two philosophers from  the ancient Greek world who changed their minds. The first is Timocrates of Lampsacus (born around the late 4th century BCE), who turned his  back on the philosophy of [Epicurus](/epicurus). And the second is the Dionysius the Renegade, his rough contemporary,  who embraced, and then turned his back on, the Stoic school of [Zeno](/zeno-of-citium).

## Timocrates renounces Epicureanism

For the Epicurean philosophers, pleasure is the highest good. To put the  philosophy in a nutshell, for the followers of Epicurus, there is no  other good but pleasure. This being the case, we need to get smarter  about pleasure. After all, the Epicureans argued, pleasure is not  something we're very good at. Many of the pleasures we seek entail pain  and discomfort. We seek pleasure and end up with the opposite. So a life dedicated to pleasure is one where we need to think harder about the  pleasures we seek, and distinguish between them more carefully.

Timocrates became a member of the Epicurean community, along with his brother  Metrodorus. Timocrates's brother was one of Epicurus's closest friends,  but Timocrates himself was less impressed by Epicurus and his followers. He left the sect, unconvinced by the claim that pleasure was the  highest good. Having left the school of Epicurus, Timocrates wrote a  work called *On Nature.* The book contained furious attacks on  Epicurus. He claimed that Epicurus was poor at reasoning, tediously  repetitious in his writing, given to over-indulgence to the point of  vomiting, disdainful of pretty much everyone, and addicted to sensual  pleasures.

Unsurprisingly, this led to a rift between the two brothers (there's nothing that the  history books like more than tales of two warring brothers). Diogenes  Laërtius tells us that Metrodorus remained a disciple of Epicurus, and  he wrote furious refutations of his brother's accusations, including a  book called *Against Timocrates*.

It's hard to know how  much credit to give Timocrates's criticisms. Although similar charges  against Epicurus were repeated for centuries afterwards, many of them  drawing on Timocrates's lurid accusations, other accounts of Epicurus's  life and person paint a picture of Epicurus as much more restrained and  abstemious. And as Timocrates's *On Nature* has not survived, we  don't know what kind of philosophy he embraced after leaving Epicurus's  school. Diogenes does say, however, that Timocrates made a “minor  career” out of pouring slander on Epicurus.

## Dionysius renounces Stoicism

Timocrates's contemporary, Dionysius the Renegade, had a conversion that was in some ways the mirror-image of that of Timocrates. Dionysius started his  philosophical life as a follower of the philosopher Heraclides Ponticus, a man whose brilliance was only matched by his pomposity.

However, Dionysius and Heraclides fell out after Dionysius perpetrated a  literary hoax. He claimed to have discovered a lost work of Sophocles,  although he'd actually authored the play himself. Heraclides was taken  in, and he cited the forgery in his own work, sure that it was authored  by the great playwright. At this point, Dionysius confessed to the hoax. Unwilling to admit he was wrong, Heraclides insisted that the work was  genuine. It was only when Dionysius revealed an acrostic hidden in the  text claiming that Heraclides was an “old monkey”, who was “ignorant of  literature” that Heraclides had to admit he was wrong. [1]

Heraclides was furious at being taken in so easily. Unsurprisingly, the hoax led  to the two of them parting ways. Next, Dionysius became a follower of [Zeno of Citium](/zeno-of-citium), the founder of the Stoic school. Stoicism emphasised the pursuit of  virtue over the pursuit of pleasure. The goal of Stoicism was an  understanding of necessity, and an imperturbable, steady and unwavering  commitment to living in accord with virtue. This seemed to have served  Dionysius well for a while, until he came down with a terrible eye  infection.

For another philosopher, this might have been a chance  to put his Stoic commitments to the test, to tough it out. But Dionysius chose otherwise. He left the Stoic school, and instead became a member  of the Cyrenaic school who, like the Epicureans, emphasised pleasure.

For the [Cyrenaics](/arete), pleasure was defined as the “smooth motion of the flesh” (this  contrasted with the Epicurean view of true pleasure as being essentially static). And for somebody afflicted by physical pain, perhaps the  philosophy of the Cyrenaics was appealing to Dionysius: it may have  provided a way forward that was not simply about bearing the suffering  of his infection, but was instead about cultivating what pleasure he  could. 

Predictably, the Stoics were no less outraged by his  defection than the Epicureans were by the defection of Timocrates  (despite all that Stoic training in imperturbability). They claimed  Dionysius had fallen into vice and indolence (much the same claim that  Timocrates levelled against Epicurus), that he spent the remainder of  his days frequenting brothels, and that he was only interested in  sensual pleasure. 

Once again, it would be good to have access to  Dionysius's own words to better appreciate his later phase philosophy.  He wrote books both during his Stoic and during his Cyrenaic years,  including *On Apathy* and *On Pleasure*. But none of these books has survived. 

## Changing your mind

What can we take away from these stories of renegade philosophers?

The first thing we can take away is that stories like these point to the  cult-like fervour of various philosophical traditions in the ancient  Greek world. The savagery of criticism and the extraordinary bitterness  of disputes on both sides – particularly when philosophers like  Timocrates and Dionysius went rogue – puts even contemporary university  philosophy departments to shame. And that is saying something.

The second thing is the idea that the trajectories of individual  philosophers in the ancient world were often more existentially charged, more messy, and more turbulent than our romanticised views of ancient  truth-seekers. Sibling rivalry and jealousy, the hunger for status,  character clashes, eye infections and other bodily ailments, the  accidents of chance and of personal biography… all these things were  part of what drove philosophers, then as now.

And finally,  perhaps, these stories remind us that although philosophy claims to be  about changing our minds, the history of philosophy has not necessarily  treated well those who have radically changed their minds. So be warned. If you are a philosopher, you go rogue at your own risk.
