## Ritual is a Creative Act

This  is the second in a two-part series on ritual. In the first piece, we  looked at how ritual helps us get by, sometimes almost magically, in a  complicated social world (you can [read part one of this series here](/philosophy-of-ritual/)). 

But ritual is more than just a way of getting by. It is also a way of  giving shape to ourselves and our shared world. To engage in ritual is  to engage in a creative act that can transform the world. Let's see how!

## Shaping Ourselves 

One philosopher who was keenly aware of the creative power of ritual was the Confucian philosopher [Xunzi](/xunzi). Xunzi is famous in particular for his claim that human nature is bad (arguing against the more sunny-natured [Mencius](/mencius), who insisted that human nature was good).

In his *Discourse on Ritual*, Xunzi says that we are born with desires that we hunger to satisfy. But desires are unlimited: when we get what we want, we just want more. And more. And more. When left unchecked, this desire for more leads to  social discord, to disharmony, and to general impoverishment. The world, alas, simply isn't built for us to fulfil all of our desires to the  greatest possible extent. 

This is why ritual matters for Xunzi.  It helps shape ourselves and manage our desires. It imposes a degree of  order or measure on our otherwise insatiable wanting.

It is worth paying attention to what Xunzi is *not* saying here. He is not claiming that we should somehow eradicate  desire, or that desire in itself is bad. Desire is simply a part of what makes us human. What we need to do is not to expunge all our desires,  but instead to nurture them in the right ways. The word for “nurture”  here is *yang* (養), which originally meant “to herd sheep” or “to tend to flocks.” So you could see ritual as a way of herding our  desires and our dispositions, so they don't cause havoc or run riot.

In an earlier [Philosopher File](/xunzi), we saw that for Xunzi, human beings are by their very nature crooked.  Human badness is the consequence of desire having no natural terminus.  This being the case, we can't rely on nature to solve our problems. We  have to invent artificial means of managing ourselves.

And this is where ritual comes in. Ritual shapes us. It regulates and manages our  desires. Through the proper use of ritual, Xunzi claims, we can find a  concordance between our desires and the material conditions of the  world. And if we can manage our desires so that the material things of  the world are not depleted or exhausted, then we can live as desiring  creatures, without the world falling into chaos. 

Imagine, for  example, that we are down to the last biscuit on the plate. If we are  both hungry, and let our desires have free rein, then we will naturally  fall into conflict. But more often than not, we don't do that. Instead  of snatching the biscuit and cramming it into our mouths, and thereby  starting a small biscuit war, we resort to ritual. We get polite. We  say, “No, please, take it, I've had enough…” And through the coolness of ritual, we manage the heat of our desires.

For Xunzi,  ritual lends our lives a good measure, putting the brakes on  excess and insufficiency. Ritual, he writes, “cuts off what is too long  and extends what is too short. It subtracts from what is excessive and  adds to what is insufficient.” [1] It is a way of making sure that we  maintain an appropriate measure when it comes to the things that make up our life: material things, our moods, our states of mind, even our  cultural practices.

And for Xunzi, this is hugely powerful because through ritual we can shape our inherent natures to such an extent that we can approach sage-like human perfection.

> Thus, I say  that human nature is the original beginning and the raw material, and  deliberate effort is what makes it patterned, ordered, and exalted. If  there were no human nature, then there would be nothing for deliberate  effort to be applied to. If there were no deliberate effort, then human  nature would not be able to beautify itself. Human nature and deliberate effort must unite, and then the reputation of the sage and the work of  unifying all under Heaven are thereupon brought to completion.[2]

## Shaping the World

But ritual isn't just about completing or shaping our*selves*. Because, as Xunzi also suggests, through ritual we complete or shape the world itself. 

> In the world, all members of the myriad things and the human race must  await the sage, and only then will they be appropriately divided up. [3]

For Xunzi, ritual allows us to give order to the myriad things of the world (*wanwu* 萬物). The world in its raw, natural state is incomplete. It is the  artificiality of ritual, while being rooted in the patterns of the  world, that brings these patterns to completion.

This idea of  ritual as something that allows us to creatively participate in the  ongoing completion of the world, is also found in other philosophical  traditions. In his fascinating comparative study of Maya and Chinese  philosophy, the philosopher [Alexus McLeod](/alexus-mcleod-maya-philosophy/) draws parallels between Xunzi's arguments about the creative power of ritual, and those of the philosophers of the [Maya world](/maya-philosophy/).

McLeod argues that for the Maya philosophers, ritual is makes us co-creators  of the world. Within Maya culture, one of the biggest ritual  preoccupations is with the “keeping of days.” The Daykeeper or *K’iche’* is responsible for keeping track of the 260-day Maya calendar. The  Daykeeper reads the patterns inherent in the world, conducts divination, and decides on the appropriate rituals and their appropriate timing. In doing so, they not only shape the social world, but also the natural  order.

> Humans *play a role* in the continual  creation of things through their daykeeping and other rituals, but these rituals are not completely conventional, arbitrarily set by humans.  Keeping the days properly and performing rituals properly is a matter of understanding the patterns inherent in the world. [4]

## Creativity and ritual

For the Maya philosophers, as for the Confucians, ritual is a means of *participation* in the ongoing creation of the world. Ritual allows us to attune ourselves to the world's patterns, and to augment them. If our rituals are  well-regulated and rooted in an attentiveness to the pre-existing world, they allow us to give order and shape to our lives and to the world we  share.

What this means is that in both these traditions, ritual is seen as something inherently creative. We can easily think of rituals  as being about doggedly repeating the same old patterns, over and over  again, as if we were on autopilot. Seen like this, ritual seems to be  the opposite of creativity. But if the Confucians and the philosophers  of the Maya world are right, then they challenge this view, forcing us  to ask: what if the reverse turned out to be the case? What if the task  of transforming the world, making it anew, cannot be accomplished  without the artfulness and the artificiality of ritual?

## Further Reading

### Books

I'm currently reading Amy Olberding's wonderful *The Wrong of Rudeness: Learning Modern Civility from Ancient Chinese Philosophy* (Oxford University Press 2019), and I really can't recommend it enough. It is  candid, clear, thoughtful, beautifully written and argued, and often  extremely funny.
