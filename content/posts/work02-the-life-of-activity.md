What is work? And how can we think better about work? Like many other things, we more or less know what work is when we don't think about it  too hard. But when we try to think a bit more deeply, or a bit more  systematically, it becomes harder to figure out. So in this piece, we'll be looking at the philosopher Hannah Arendt, whose exploration of the *vita activa*, or “the active life”, is a useful way to start getting a handle on the role that work plays in human life. 

### Who was Hannah Arendt?

In her book *The Human Condition*, Arendt contrasts the *vita contemplativa*, or “the contemplative life”, and the *vita activa*, or the “active life.” For Arendt, human life involves both  contemplation and activity. And this dual commitment to both thinking  and doing was reflected in her own life. Arendt was not only a political theorist and a philosopher, but she was also an educator and an  activist who engaged actively in politics.

Hannah Arendt was born  in Hanover, Germany in 1906. She studied with some of the most  significant philosophers working in Germany during the first half of the 20th century. After studying at the University of Marburg with Martin  Heidegger, she briefly enrolled in classes with Edmund Husserl, the  founder of the movement in philosophy called phenomenology, a rich  philosophical tradition that explores the textures and structures of  human experience. Arendt then wrote her PhD in Heidelberg under the  supervision of the philosopher Karl Jaspers. Her thesis, completed in  1926, was on the concept of love in the work of the philosopher Saint  Augustine.

By this time, Anti-Semitism was on the rise in Germany. And Arendt, who was herself Jewish, realised that a  future in Germany  was increasingly unviable. When the Nazi party came to power in 1933,  she fled—first to Prague, and then to Paris. In Paris, she worked for  several Jewish refugee organisations until the outbreak of the Second  World War. She was briefly imprisoned in 1941, after which Arendt fled  France, this time to New York.

In New York, Arendt continued to write and teach, eventually settling and becoming a US citizen. She published *The Human Condition* in 1958.

Although she held several visiting positions at universities both in the US and  globally, Arendt resisted the temptation to take on a tenured role in a  university preferring the freedom of combining writing, teaching,  politics and other work. Arendt died in New York in 1975, her book *The Life of the Mind*, the sequel to which she saw as a part of the same project as *The Human Condition*, still unfinished.

## Contemplation and activity

The Greek philosopher Aristotle saw the *vita contemplativa* as the ultimate aim of human life. For Aristotle, *theōria* or contemplation was far more important than *praxis or* practical activity ([see the article here](/wisdom02-navigating-wisdom)). In other words, the ultimate justification of practical activity was that it should help support contemplation. *Doing better* is valuable, Aristotle claims, only to the extent that it helps us with *thinking better*.

These days, however, we are likely to see things in reverse. If we seem like  we are getting too theoretical, people are likely to call us out and  say, “That's all fine, but what practical use is any of this?” What  matters for us is *action* rather than *contemplation*. Our own position, in other words, is the precise opposite of that of Aristotle: the ultimate purpose of *thinking better* is *doing better*. 

For Arendt, this reversal of the hierarchy between thinking and doing is  one of the most important transformations in Western thought. 

> Perhaps the most momentous of the spiritual consequences of the discoveries of  the modern age [...] has been the reversal of the hierarchical order  between the ****vita contemplativa**** and the ****vita activa**.\* [1]*

Perhaps the most famous example of this reversal is in the work of Karl Marx. In his *Theses on Feuerbach*, Marx complains that we are too hung up on contemplation and  insufficiently attentive to “sensuous human activity.” And he challenges us to ask what it would be to think about human life not just as  something to theorise about, but instead as something that we can  actively shape. Marx ends his *Theses* with the famous claim that:

> The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point is to change it. [2]

Thinking differently about the world is all very well. But for Marx, the  ultimate justification of philosophy lies in whether it allows us to  behave differently, or to act differently.

## Seeing human being whole

For Aristotle, there is a hierarchy between thinking and doing, with  thinking having the upper hand. Marx turns this hierarchy upside down  and says that doing should have the upper hand. For Arendt, however, the problem is the hierarchy itself. Instead of seeing the *vita contemplativa* and the *vita activa* as existing in a hierarchical relationship, she claims that we should instead see them as different aspects of human life.

One reason that Arendt resists these hierarchies is that once you have a  hierarchy like this, you commit yourself to the idea that there is one  ultimate principle of human life. And when you have decided that human  life is governed by a single principle, you have to make everything else fall into line around this principle.

This not only narrows the  scope of human life, but also muddies our thinking. Many things matter  in human life. Contemplation is good, in and of itself. But likewise,  digging the garden is good. So is making a chair out of wood, or baking a cake, or putting on a play. There are many different good things. And  if you try to gather them together under a single principle, you miss  the complexity and the diversity of human life. So in resisting these  hierarchies, Arendt wanted to open the door to seeing human being whole, so that we can start to understand human life in its complexity and its messiness.

### Anatomising the vita activa

In *The Human Condition*, Arendt asks what it means for human beings to act. She defines the *vita activa* as “human life in so far as it is actively engaged in doing something.” We are not beings who just sit and contemplate. We also do stuff. But  human activity is very diverse, so to get a handle on this diversity,  Arendt divides this activity into three broad categories: “labour”,  “work” and “action.” 

> With the term *vita activa*, I propose to designate three fundamental human activities: labor, work, and action. They are fundamental because each corresponds to one of the basic conditions under which life on earth has been given to man. [3]

#### Labour

At the most fundamental level, we need to provide for our bodily,  biological needs. We need to feed ourselves. We need fresh water. We  need shelter. Arendt calls this struggle to meet our biological needs *labour*.

Imagine you are marooned on a desert island. Fortunately, the island has an  abundance of good fresh fruit, tasty tubers, and flavoursome rodents to  feast on. In the centre of the island is a small spring that provides  fresh water. You have everything you need. But to sustain your daily  life in this little paradise, you have to put in the time. You have to  pick those fruits, dig up those tubers, chase down those rodents, and go back and forth to the spring to gather water. This is what Arendt means by labour.

Before you live too long on your desert island, you  realise that the thing about labour is that it is never-ending and  interminable. If you want to go on surviving, we have to keep on digging up tubers and chasing down rodents and carrying water.

For  Arendt, this means that at some very basic level, we are not free. We  are bound to our biological needs, and as these needs will continue as  long as we live, so too will the need for labour.

#### Work

The trouble with labour is that it is cyclical. It doesn't go  anywhere. It doesn't build anything for the future. It just keeps you  ticking along. But human beings also act on the world not just to meet  their needs, but to *reshape* the world, so it can better provide for them. This is what Arendt calls *work*. Work is about producing something—a result—that will continue to endure in the world after the work is done.

Through work, we don't just sustain our survival. Instead, we turn the world  into a world that is partly human-made. We create objects and  institutions that endure. If on your desert island, you decide to build a little hut to live in, then that is work. You spend a few days  building, and at the end of it, your world is slightly different from  how it was before.

Arendt complains that past thinkers have  obscured the distinction between labour and work. They have seen the  activity of digging for tubers and the activity of building a hut as the same thing. But work is not just about bare survival. It is about  bringing something new into being. Once you have reshaped the world  through work, you have won for yourself a degree of freedom. You can sit in your new hut, snug and cosy, and enjoy the benefits of your new  shelter, long after the work is done. 

Arendt herself knows that the boundary between labour and work is blurred. There *are* ongoing tasks to sustain the products of your work—the roof needs fixing from  time to time—and none of the objects that we fabricate is entirely  durable. But the products of our work are capable of outlasting us. And  for this reason, work, unlike labour, has a social dimension. If you get rescued from that desert island, it won't matter to the next castaway  that you have laboured to pick and eat fruit. But the house you have  worked on will still be standing, and the new castaway can move in.

#### Action

The third kind of activity that Arendt explores is action. Action is  profoundly social. Action is what happens when we come together in  society with others, each of us with our own uniqueness, our own  talents, our own qualities, and our own concerns, and we try to work out how to refashion our shared world.

If the active life  was only about labour and work, nothing would ever change. We'd just  keep on remaking the world in the same way as it had always been. Work  just replicates the same structures again and again. But action is where change starts to happen. Action is about acting in society with others  to change the structures of which we are a part. And this process is  fundamentally social. There is no action, Arendt argues, in isolation.  There is no action for our castaway.

Action is also where we are  most free. When we are labouring, we are caught up in necessity. We are  subject to our bodily needs and unfree. When we are working, we free  ourselves to some extent from these needs by reshaping the world so that we can enjoy a degree of freedom. But our freedom is still limited. We  are still a part of the world that we have inherited, and all of its  structures.

It is only when we engage in action that we start to  reshape, reimagine and reinvent our shared world. Action is when we say, “Hey, it doesn't have to be like this. How about we do it this way  instead?” Or it is when we take to the streets to protest. Or it is when we get together to rethink our shared world.

### Giving birth to new worlds

One way of thinking about this is by thinking in terms of what Arendt calls “natality.” Philosophers are often preoccupied with mortality, by the  fact that human beings die. But they pay less attention to the way that  human beings give birth to new things and new worlds. Natality is about  the every-present possibility of change. It is about the way we can  together give birth to newness in the world.

> Labour and  work, as well as action, are also rooted in natality in so far as they  have the task to provide and preserve the world for, to foresee and  reckon with, the constant influx of newcomers who are born into the  world as strangers.
>
> However, of the three, action has the closest connection with the human condition of natality; the new beginning  inherent in birth can make itself felt in the world only because the  newcomer possesses the capacity of beginning something anew, that is, of acting. In this sense of initiative, an element of action, and  therefore of natality, is inherent in all human activities.
>
> Moreover, since action is the political activity par excellence, natality, and  not mortality, may be the central category of political, as  distinguished from metaphysical, thought. [4]

For Arendt, this is the highest question of the *vita activa.* How do we transform the world? What new worlds do we want to give birth to? And when we are asking these questions, we are at our most free.

## Discussion questions

1. Arendt argues that in the modern era, we have reversed the traditional  hierarchy between thinking and doing. What is most important to us these days is *action* rather than *contemplation*. But is Arendt right about this? Or do we still value contemplation more highly?
2. In your own *vita activa*, how much of your activity is *labour*, how much is *work*, and how much is *action*? 
3.  Can philosophy help contribute to what Arendt calls “action”—in other  words, to changing the structures of which we are a part? If so, how?
4. Philosophers think a lot about mortality, the fact that we all die. But how might it change our approach to philosophy if we thought more about natality—the fact that we are all capable of creating new things in the world?
