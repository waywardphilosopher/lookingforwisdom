## Who's behind Looking for Wisdom?

_Looking for Wisdom_ is a project of the Wind&Bones Community Interest Company, a non-profit social enterprise based in the UK. [Wind&Bones](https://www.windandbones.com) explores how creative thinking and creative writing can be used to bring about positive social change.

The site is edited and curated by Dr Will Buckingham. Will has a PhD in philosophy and an MA in anthropology. He has written both academic and popular philosophy and has been translated into multiple languages. His most recent book is _Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World_  (Granta 2021/2022). He also contributed to the global bestseller (7 million copies sold!), _The Philosophy Book_. Will has taught philosophy for almost two decades, both in universities and in the community, and believes that philosophy is too important and too urgent to be left to academics. Find out more [on Will's website](https://www.willbuckingham.com).

Dr Hannah Stevens is in charge of the site's social media, making sure that the philosophy is comprehensible and practical, and cooking up fun projects and plans for how to put all that thinking to work. Hannah has a PhD in creative writing, and writes mainly fiction. She has worked in universities in Myanmar, Bulgaria, and the UK, and believes that creative thinking can transform the world. Her book, _In Their Absence_, was published in 2021. Find out more [on Hannah's website](https://www.hannahstevenswriter.com).
